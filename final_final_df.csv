spoilersthe night that ally and jackson first meet she explains to him that her looks in particular her nose has kept her from successally almost every single person has told i liked the way i sounded but they didnt like the way i i think youre main reason she hasnt found success is that the music industry is very appearanceconscious or shallow when she is with jackson though he loves her the way she is big nose and shallow has a second meaning ally is an honest artist who has something to say making her message deep in the second half of the film her manager rez convinces ally to begin performing simple pop songs which are considered mindless and shallow by go off the deep end means to lose control of yourself or go crazy usually out of anger ally wants to be judged for her voice her talent and her message not her looks shes genuine and she might be considered crazy for sees through jacksons hardcore rock star persona he struggles with alcoholism which he uses to try to fill the void left by his troublesome relationship with his late father and older poses this question to jackson on the very first night they meet this makes jackson vulnerable since ally is able to quickly see the real person beneath the persona that he puts on for the line im falling has a double meaning in the first sense he may be falling into his alcoholic tendencies and is getting caught up in his rock star lifestyle on the other hand this is a subtle nod to ally indicating that hes falling in love with her the mirrored narrative throughout the song shows that the characters help each other in different ways jackson helps ally propel her career while ally helps jackson with his internal battles,verse bradley cooper tell me somethin girl are you happy in this modern world or do you

shaha shalalalalow in the shaha shahahalow were far from the shallow nowwarning contains spoilersthe night that ally and jackson first meet she explains to him that her looks in particular her nose has kept her from successally almost every single person has told i liked the way i sounded but they didnt like the way i i think youre main reason she hasnt found success is that the music industry is very appearanceconscious or shallow when she is with jackson though he loves her the way she is big nose and shallow has a second meaning ally is an honest artist who has something to say making her message deep in the second half of the film her manager rez convinces ally to begin performing simple pop songs which are considered mindless and shallow by go off the deep end means to lose control of yourself or go crazy usually out of anger ally wants to be judged for her voice her talent and her message not her looks shes genuine and she might be considered crazy for sees through jacksons hardcore rock star persona he struggles with alcoholism which he uses to try to fill the void left by his troublesome relationship with his late father and older poses this question to jackson on the very first night they meet this makes jackson vulnerable since ally is able to quickly see the real person beneath the persona that he puts on for the line im falling has a double meaning in the first sense he may be falling into his alcoholic tendencies and is getting caught up in his rock star lifestyle on the other hand this is a subtle nod to ally indicating that hes falling in love with her the mirrored narrative throughout the song shows that the characters help each other in different ways jackson helps ally propel her career while ally helps jackson with his internal battles,5.0

as i nut you can gon leave got ms in the bank like yes indeed me and my dawg goin all the way when you livin like this they supposed to hate outro future wheezy outta here,this could a reference to how much income the rappers of the s such as received during the it could be that in the s many drug dealers had a large income based on a large client base and a constant need for supply he could be saying that although not many people are needing crack and cocaine he still makes bank off of selling what he and very aggressive line from lil he equals the price of some shoes with the life of his tells us that he buys a pair of shoes or orders to kill with the same ease and for the same price while making fun of the the ganster slang youngins means young ones in several thugganster lifestyles young people are used to carry out criminal activities because they get better legal treatment avoiding jail in some likely a nod to drakes love for wearing hooded also drops in a subtle shout out to his loyal girl who he references further down in his she held it down so she got a mercedesthis is most likely drake reflecting on his early days in the music he first started in music drake was a signee to birdmans ymcmb and though he still in part represents the label fast forward a few years and drake owns one of the most popular record labels and collectives in his time ovo octobers very own ovo has a hand in fashion music radio and even has its very own annual at first he took what he was given but now he is the one giving out opportunities and making decisions for drake has had his fair share of beef over the years his loyal friends and label mates which he had around from his early days in toronto canada are still working with him till this notably drakes producer and engineer and genius noah shebib who has been working with drake since the beginning of has echoed similar lyrics about his loyalty to his friends over industry personnel in his pm in new york freestyle in off his if youre reading this its too late albumim managed by my friends that i grew up withid rather give that to people i fuck withlil baby briefly explained this lyric in his breakfast club interview by saying that after he nuts she needs to leave so he can sleep however he confirmed he was currently in a relationship and that this mindset was one of his older lifelil babys breakfast club interview explaining this is available on song made it to lil babys debut album harder than ever and with first week sales it was projected to reach anywhere between kk there is no doubt that the collaboration with drake was the catalyst for these impressive people refer to this reaction as the drake effect where drakes mention cosign or feature increases the popularity and sometimes sales of

49,Ella Mai,Trip,intro ooh yeah yeah verse i put my feelings on safety so i dont go shootin where your heart be cause you take the bullet tryna save me then im left to deal with makin you bleed prechorus and thats a whole lotta love aint tryna waste it like we be runnin a mile to never make it thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna taste it thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna face it chorus but i think that im done trippin im triptrippin ive been sippin thats how i control this feelin you keep givin you keep on hittin it ooh oh maybe its your love its too good to be true baby boy your love got me trippin on you you know your love is big enough make me trip up on you yeah its big enough got me trippin on you triptrippin on you postchorus my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you verse boy you know we cool when i aint waitin but i act a fool when i dont get it and im steady bruisin just to save this but i tripped on your love now im addicted prechorus and thats a whole lotta love aint tryna waste it like we be runnin a mile to never make it thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna taste it thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna face it chorus but i think that im done trippin im triptrippin ive been sippin thats how i control this feelin you keep givin you keep on hittin it ooh oh maybe its your love its too good to be true baby boy your love got me trippin on you you know your love is big enough make me trip up on you yeah its big enough got me trippin on you triptrippin on you postchorus my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you trippin on you my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you trippin on you bridge thats some kind of love baby drip drip thats the type of love make me trip trip trippin on you its big enough make me drip drip its big enough got me trip trip trippin on you chorus im done trippin im triptrippin ive been sippin thats how i control this feelin you keep givin you keep on hittin it ooh oh maybe its your love its too good to be true baby boy your love got me trippin on you you know your love is big enough make me trip up on you yeah its big enough got me trippin on you triptrippin on you postchorus my bad my bad for trippin on you my bad my bad my bad trippin on you yeah my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you trippin on you baby my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you said i admit i was wrong when i did it my bad my bad my bad for trippin on you trippin on you trippin on you outro trippin on you yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah,sometimes it just feels like you are just surrounded and you just feel like youre surrounded with good love or bad love like i said this song can be interpreted so many different ways so the way i wrote it was obviously from a sense of this is not necessarily a bad situation its almost too good so im trying to make it bad to protect myself if that makes sense i think a lot of us do that in a lot of cases but it could mean anything trippin it could mean anything but for me its basically when you feel like its too good to be true and youre tryna make sure that you dont get hurt because im very definitely feel like love can feel like a drug sometimes sometimes you feel like if youre not getting back the same love that youre putting in youre withdrawn almost and you just feel like you need it and sometimes you cant put your finger on what exactly it is about it or about the person that makes you love them so much sometimes you cant understand and i think thats why sometimes people stay in bad relationships and thats why good relationships last so long it can be both sides of the spectrum definitely have been a situation where i felt like this might be too good to be true and you kind of take a backseat and its like maybe i should chill out but then again again in the sense of what the song is i come to find out that i was just making myself believe that because at the end of the day sometimes its not too good to be true sometimes it really can be a real love you knowif you go through the verse and then go through the prechorus its almost like ive created this situation in my head that somethings happening or ive put this wall up because of whats happened to me before and im kind of expecting you to do the same thing so the chorus is a moment of realization of being like wait i have to give everyone an even playing field and be like this is actually me im making something up that doesnt exist so im done trippinso this is the interesting part because everyone thinks i said its just too bitter for words but we were using a play on when you get married its actually worse when you get married you say for better or for worse right in wedding vows right so thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna taste it is as in imagine if youre getting married to someone and they say for better or for worse but were using better as bitter because this is a bitter situation so it was kind of a play on words i dont think anyone got but its fine because i love think those are actually my favorite lines of the song because especially me im a big lover like i have a lot of love to give im a very loving person and i would hate to give it to someone who doesnt deserve it or i feel like isnt really giving it back to me and yeah i think if you think about running a marathon youve put all of this training in youve put all of this working out eating well like preparing yourself for this marathon and you get to the marathon and you do k of that k and then you just collapse or something gets in your way and you no longer can do the extra k or the last k that youre supposed to do and its like all of that effort all of that preparation that youve put in to not make it to where your end goal was thats frustrating i feel like its the same in the sense of putting time and effort and loving someone to not get there in the end that just makes everything not worth it,intro ooh yeah yeah verse i put my feelings on safety so i dont go shootin where your heart be cause you take the bullet tryna save me then im left to deal with makin you bleed prechorus and

limbo place where youve broken up but someone keeps opening the door up a little bit and you come back in its all very messy and that relates to someone pushing you away as well its empty promises being made to someone when in reality something else is happening behind the scenes that you might not have seen and you just kind of find was based off those really youthful and naive promises you make the first time that you might have fallen in love its like you really do make those promises and you dont understand the depth or the actual commitment that youre speaking of the power of the words when you use them for the first time like weapons so its like for me it was something that i really didnt understand and something that ive said to someone in the past and they had said things to me as well and that lyric represents the naivety of using words that you dont fully comprehend singer puts their all into the relationship whereas their partner doesnt care this could be seen as unrequited love when the love between two people only comes from one of the pair from the lines above this also shows that the other person isnt making this separation easy and is clearing being difficult about s someone being with other people or a person behind youre back and thinking that no one can like theses schmucks cant take my place or whatever yeah i mean on a literal term its just yeah youre oblivious of what was happening behind youre back and you want to kind of know that now you know that they should kind of feel bad about it and i hope that you see my face instead of theirs or whatever which is kind of weird but you know its obviously in a dark definitely the use of the word crawl was like what it feels defeated it feels like youre coming s just that power that the person has over you and youre a puppet to them youll do whatever just to retrieve the feeling that you think is important or best for you because you dont know whats best for you i guess so its the powerlessness youre fragile and your kind of at this persons every beck and call and i think thats a lyric of frustration and s always going to be a little different for everyone in the band but youngblood for me is a way that we were living at the time were writing it and also youngblood is a person whose persona is very on and off push and give and take and all that kind of good stuff its such a visual word you can visualize the feelings of the word as well and i think that always is what connected with me about that lyric and especially how strong it strikes in the chorus as this being kind of like an allencompassing thing of what is youngblood thats what i think is so cool about the song its like even when we were playing it live the other night it didnt feel like the somber depressing moment it felt like this empowering kind of piece of music that makes you feel something and its so diverse in what it stands for and what it means and i think thats why its managed to connect the way it has because i feel like no matter how you look at it theres still some sort of relevance you can find in your life to the actual music thats happening in the prechorus feels like tension and it does feel like pushing and pulling and i think thats one of the parts that i like in this song as well the lyric binds really well with the tension that builds in the prechorus of youngbloodthose lyrics are kind of in that limbo place where youve broken up but someone keeps opening the door up a little bit and you come back in its all very messy and that relates to someone

the youtube live release party for pray for the wicked that the chorus for high hopes was the first chorus written for the albumthe chorus was given to me by a friend named ilsey she had this whole idea and the perfect message it felt just how i wanted to iterate to people about my childhood making cardboard cutouts of guitars and acting like a rock people have interpreted this lyric to mean that pray for the wicked will be the last panic at the disco album brendon urie addressed this idea in an interview with nme expressing his desire to continue panic for a long timewhen writing the lyric i didnt take it that way but who knows im so impulsive i could say that this will never be the last but i dont know whats going to happen tomorrow i dont have any plans to stop ever anytime soon i want to be like mick jaggers age and still doing it thats the dreama prophecy isthe foretelling or prediction of what is to comefulfilling a prophecy means to make a prediction come lyrics hint at the idea that brendon was destined to do something great that he should look to fulfill the prophecy that had been set out for at the discos introduction into and approach within the music industry has been far from one of the first bands to garner recognition and success through the internet they were nonconformists in an industry with deeprooted conventions and expectations and instead of having little commercial success they took the world by storm as stranger crusadersthroughout commercial radios musical eras characterized by the dominance of hip hop and pop panic has always opted for the weird and the novelties instead notably switching from the pop punk and vaudevillian theatrics of their debut a fever you cant sweat out to the flower crowns and beatlesinspired psychedelic and baroque pop of their sophomore album pretty odd panic takes pride in their label as odditiesby following their own interests and disregarding the pressure of their contemporaries panic established a precedent of never giving up in environments that only seem to ostracize them and of never changing themselves at the expense of their quirks and brendon urie and panic at the discos career the band has continually changed genre and shifted the status quo from the s inspired psychedelia of pretty odd to the electronic club synths of too weird to live too rare to die panic has delved into a new sound with each some may believe that panic has done everything that is possible for a band to do brendon urie believes that only the best is yet to come for panicthe phrase but they havent seen the best of me is also reminiscent of a lyric in this is gospel which states but they havent seen the best of us yetmuseum victories refers to paintings of battles that are often housed in art museums rulers or military officers would often commission artwork to commemorate their great victories these works of art are typically over the top in their depictions portraying the victors as shining striving for museum victories urie continues the theme of seeking out the very best in everything that he does achieving goals so great that they deserve to have commemorative paintings commissioned in their singleton copley the death of major peirson the manifest destiny was a belief held by thcentury american settlers that it was their godgiven right or destiny to settle westwardmanifest destiny in the context of high hopes refers to the view that brendon was destined to be a musician and share his craft with the progress by john gast is an allegorical representation of the modernization of the new the early days of panic at the disco the band had very little money only big passions and dreams in music their lack of funds can be especially noted in their first album and most notably in their single i write sins not tragediesin an interview on the zach sang show brendon sharedwe had ten thousand dollars to do the first album we had like no money at that point we couldnt even get an extra two hundred dollars to pay someone in to come and play trumpet we had to pay a sixth grader to come in and play trumpet and we recorded each note separately so if you listen to i write sins not tragedies first single off first album we recorded a girl who was you know years old playing cello one note at a time and we just took them and sampled them basically played it

for a living didnt know how but i always had a feeling i was gonna be that one in a million always had high high hopes high high hopesbrendon revealed at the youtube live release party for pray for the wicked that the chorus for high hopes was the first chorus written for the albumthe chorus was given to me by a friend named ilsey she had this whole idea and the perfect message it felt just how i wanted to iterate to people about my childhood making cardboard cutouts of guitars and acting like a rock people have interpreted this lyric to mean that pray for the wicked will be the last panic at the disco album brendon urie addressed this idea in an interview with nme expressing his desire to continue panic for a long timewhen writing the lyric i didnt take it that way but who knows im so impulsive i could say that this will never be the last but i dont know whats going to happen tomorrow i dont have any plans to stop ever anytime soon i want to be like mick jaggers age and still doing it thats the dreama prophecy isthe foretelling or prediction of what is to comefulfilling a prophecy means to make a prediction come lyrics hint at the idea that brendon was destined to do something great that he should look to fulfill the prophecy that had been set out for at the discos introduction into and approach within the music industry has been far from one of the first bands to garner recognition and success through the internet they were nonconformists in an industry with deeprooted conventions and expectations and instead of having little commercial success they took the world by storm as stranger crusadersthroughout commercial radios musical eras characterized by the dominance of hip hop and pop panic has always opted for the weird and the novelties instead notably switching from the pop punk and vaudevillian theatrics of their debut a fever you cant sweat out to the flower crowns and beatlesinspired psychedelic and baroque pop of their sophomore album pretty odd panic takes pride in their label as odditiesby following their own interests and disregarding the pressure of their contemporaries panic established a precedent of never giving up in environments that only seem to ostracize them and of never changing themselves at the expense of their quirks and brendon urie and panic at the discos career the band has continually changed genre and shifted the status quo from the s inspired psychedelia of pretty odd to the electronic club synths of too weird to live too rare to die panic has delved into a new sound with each some may believe that panic has done everything that is possible for a band to do brendon urie believes that only the best is yet to come for panicthe phrase but they havent seen the best of me is also reminiscent of a lyric in this is gospel which states but they havent seen the best of us yetmuseum victories refers to paintings of battles that are often housed in art museums rulers or military officers would often commission artwork to commemorate their great victories these works of art are typically over the top in their depictions portraying the victors as shining striving for museum victories urie continues the theme of seeking out the very best in everything that he does achieving goals so great that they deserve to have commemorative paintings commissioned in their singleton copley the death of major peirson the manifest destiny was a belief held by thcentury american settlers that it was their godgiven right or destiny to settle westwardmanifest destiny in the context of high hopes refers to the view that brendon was destined to be a musician and share his craft with the progress by john gast is an allegorical representation of the modernization of the new the early days of panic at the disco the band had very little money only big passions and dreams in music their lack of funds can be especially noted in their first album and most notably in their single i write sins not tragediesin an interview on the zach sang show brendon sharedwe had ten thousand dollars to do the first album we had like no money at that point we couldnt even get an extra two hundred dollars to pay someone in to come and play trumpet we had to pay a sixth grader to come in and play trumpet and we recorded each note separately so if you listen to i write sins not tragedies first single off first album we recorded a girl who was you know years old playing cello one note at a time and we just took them and sampled them basically played it like an mpc so we actually did that like by hand it was really having little money to keep their band and themselves personally afloat their vision of achieving success was enough to sustain line also calls back to a similar lyric in fuck a silver liningwas lost in thought but held my visionthis lyric refers to brendon possibly being overwhelmed or lost but ultimately remaining set on his biography is a work of writing that outlines a persons experiences and includes

106,Bazzi,Mine,intro huh yeah naw i just had a lil bit too much of hennessy just gotta tell you how i feel look verse you so fuckin precious when you smile hit it from the back and drive you wild girl i lose myself up in those eyeeyeeyeeyeeyes i just had to let you know youre mine chorus hands on your body i dont wanna waste no time feels like forever even if forevers tonight just lay with me waste this night away with me youre mine i cant look away i just gotta say verse im so fucking happy youre alive swear to god im down if youre down all you gotta say is right girl anything i can do just to make you feel alright oh oh oh oh i just had to let you know youre fine running circles round my mind even when its rainy all you ever do is shine you on fire you a star just like mariah man this feel incredible ill turn you into a bride youre mine chorus hands on your body i dont wanna waste no time feels like forever even if forevers tonight just lay with me waste this night away with me youre mine i cant look away i just gotta say,that line is so real this girl is literally just sitting on my brain i cant stop thinking about you not sounding too crazy but it feels nice to think about somebody you care about everything about love is really interesting to me im young and i dont want to fall into it too hard right now just because im trying to do something with music im trying to do something for people and you need a certain level of focus to achieve that but love is a beautiful thing its what we all live for we all just want to be loved we all just want to feel somebody and feel connected to somebody in a real d do anything for somebody i care about absolutely anything but i feel like the most valuable thing you can do with somebody is be real with them share genuine feelings with them share honest feelings with them when you can give somebody something real and special i feel like thats the most valuable thing you can give someone real emotion is the most valuable thing you can give someone what i would do for somebody thats mine anything literally whatever it is that doesnt even necessarily just go for a girl its like my friends and my family if you are personal to me and we are connected in that way of deep friendship in whatever means it is i would do anything for the people that i line was really important for me its my favorite line of the entire song because i feel like people needed to hear that people really do someone out there wants you here its fucking sad people are afraid to get someones back but i want to be the guy that does i want to be the guy that encourages you and pushes you i feel like people definitely needed to hear that hook just kind of felt natural to me my music process is very whats supposed to be there or what my brain thinks is supposed to be there i dont like to be too repetitive in music and ruin something good rather than elevate you and take you somewhere else that you didnt think you were going thats my job as a creator as an artist to put you on that journey when you listen to my music and keep you in it and keep you on your toes this hook just felt big and it felt filled with so much feeling it was really easy to rock with lot of my lines in my songs are really just based off feelings sometimes ill just freestyle something over and over again until i say something i like this line came out during one of the freestyle takes and obviously mariah carey is such a star the things and records she achieved in her career are pretty wild so its cool that it worked so well but it really just came out of a freestyle and i just rocked with it i never think too hard about music because i think once you start becoming a selfconscious artist and question everything you do thats when stuff is not that good rather than when you just go with the first thing that comes to your mind and the first thing that felt good its like life just rocking with your gut thats what i did with this pull from a bunch of different places when writing this there is someone that was in my mind that definitely helped bring that feeling to the track but id say it was pretty evenly split between that and genuinely wanting to make a song for people and genuinely wanting to bring something light to a dark second i wrote the song i knew people were just gonna resonate with that a lot im happy i was right about that because i really made the song less about a person but more about wanting to give people a feeling of acceptance in a really sad world right now social media has made people so insecure and selfconscious i wanted to make something that broke through that and hit people with a message of being wanted and a message of being beautiful i think people really felt that energy it was reciprocated really hennessy line is super interesting because i used to be a huge hennessy drinker huge i would only drink hennessy i actually talk about it in a few of my songs a fan pointed it out the other day i was like fuck i do say that a lot i gotta chill but i loved hennessy and it was actually on a vibe at that whole time period of my life i would only work in the studio when i had hennessy it was a studio requirement like a fucking plug for the speakers i needed it there i was drinking a ton of hennessy at the time but now dont get me wrong but im more of a tequila guy im getting into the finer tequilas is my current favorite hennessy was very real in the creation of that line was also seriously what was happening the day i wrote the song it was a really hot summer day i was hanging with some friends and some girls by the pool we were just having a few drinks and smoking nothing crazy i went inside to grab a drink and the melody just hit me in the head i instantly knew what i wanted the entire song to look pull from a bunch of different places when writing this there is someone that was in my mind that definitely helped bring that feeling to the track but id say it was pretty evenly split between that and genuinely wanting to make a song for people and genuinely wanting to bring something light to a dark world,intro huh yeah naw i just had a lil bit too

i used to be a huge hennessy drinker huge i would only drink hennessy i actually talk about it in a few of my songs a fan pointed it out the other day i was like fuck i do say that a lot i gotta chill but i loved hennessy and it was actually on a vibe at that whole time period of my life i would only work in the studio when i had hennessy it was a studio requirement like a fucking plug for the speakers i needed it there i was drinking a ton of hennessy at the time but now dont get me wrong but im more of a tequila guy im getting into the finer tequilas is my current favorite hennessy was very real in the creation of that line was also seriously what was happening the day i wrote the song it was a really hot summer day i was hanging with some friends and some girls by the pool we were just having a few drinks and smoking nothing crazy i went inside to grab a drink and the melody just hit me in the head i instantly knew what i wanted the entire song to look pull from a bunch of different places when writing this there is someone that was in my mind that definitely helped bring that feeling to the track but id say it was pretty evenly split between that and genuinely wanting to make a song for people and genuinely wanting to bring something light to a dark world,2.0

144,Ella Mai,Boo'd Up,intro yeah yeah yeah yeah verse feelings so deep in my feelings no this aint really like me cant control my anxiety feeling like im touching the ceiling when im with you i cant breathe boy you do something to me prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go verse oh how many ways can i say that i need you baby its true i think i might die without you feeling all over my body you know how i like it aint gotta tell you what to do yeah yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bridge head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more baby hah i wanna build this love and everything you want you aint gotta ask for you got me bood up bood up bood up bood up told you from the jump id only choose ya ya got me bood up bood up bood up bood up grab me by the waist baby pull me closer yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new yeah baby that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up ooh bood biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go,this is a bit of a play on words here as ella is referring to the joys of being bood up and the sparks of a new relationship but she also cleverly uses badum bood up to mimic the sound of a heartbeat which is also a symbolism of im the one to choose when im right i know im right when im wrong i know im wrong it might take me a minute but i know im wrong but when im right im right so told you from the jump id always choose youi told you i was going to be the one basically and here i am the s like reassurance but thats also building trust you have to definitely let the person know and again thats communication as well you have to reassure people and let them know im still here even if youre not going through a bad situation even just telling someone i love you before its too late even outside of a romantic relationship like family just telling people you love them and showing your love for anyone you love is very important because you never know it also feels good when someone says i love you or someone explains to you how they is definitely number one without trust theres no point you cant move forward i think trusting communication being honest which is again part of trusting i think its definitely something you have to take one step at a time i dont think there is something that you can put in chronological order to say right this is what we do and were going to take it off the checklist every one situation is completely different but trust i would say is the number one m a strong believer of when you go out searching for something you dont really find exactly what youre searching for because i think youre too concentrated on number one number two number three number fourall these different things that perfection doesnt exist so if you go out searching for something that you have to take off all these different boxes youre not going to find someone that takes off every single box because that just doesnt exist right when you dont look for it and it just kind of comes out of nowhere and surprises you it almost feels like all those boxes are ticked anyway even if theres something at the bottom of the list that isnt it but its just again the feeling of love i think love in general can definitely sweep you off your feet and thats why i say head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more its like you dont have to search anymore if you were searching you dont have to search anymore and even if you dont you dont have to search anymore because im not going if your heart stops beating you die you stop breathing you die and you no longer exist i feel like sometimes you can be so in love with someone or just infatuated with someone that you feel like if they leave what are you going to do like theres nothing left for me to do when of course there is but that feeling again is if i dont have you then i dont know how ill do with myself especially when you get so used to a situation as well and youre like this is what im used to ive been with you for however many years blah blah blah im used to this then all of a sudden for arguments sake again theyre not there then you feel like you might as well not be there either it can be very hard but were sticking to the positive side of love definitely think love is a drug its something that you can be so caught up on for so long and i think thats also why people stay in good relationships and thats why people stay in bad relationships because its almost like an addiction you get addicted to the person and you cant let go of them especially when youve been together for years and years and years theres just so much history and its hard to detach yourself i feel like sometimes love overrides your mind your brain and your thinking s almost like you begin to believe that this is like a fairy talk or its almost too good to be true then you start to think down the line of wow now i have this to compare everything else to for arguments sake god forbid it doesnt work out in this situation the next person i find if theyre not showing me the same feelings and im not feeling the same way about them as i feel about you then im never going to get over you,intro yeah yeah yeah yeah verse feelings so deep in my feelings no this aint really like me cant control my anxiety feeling like im touching the ceiling when im with you i cant breathe boy you do something to me prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go verse oh how many ways can i say that i need you baby its true i think i might die without you feeling all over my body you know how i like it aint gotta tell you what to do yeah yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bridge head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more baby hah i wanna build this love and everything you want you aint gotta ask for you got me bood up bood up bood up bood up told you from the jump id only choose ya ya got me bood up bood up bood up bood up grab me by the waist baby pull me closer yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new yeah baby that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up ooh bood biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it gothis is a bit of a play on words here as ella is referring to the joys of being bood up and the sparks of a new relationship but she also cleverly uses badum bood up to mimic the sound of a heartbeat which is also a symbolism of im the one to choose when im right i know im right when im wrong i know im wrong it might take me a minute but i know im wrong but when im right im right so told you from the jump id always choose youi told you i was going to be the one basically and here i am the s like reassurance but thats also building trust you have to definitely let the person know and again thats communication as well you have to reassure people and let them know im still here even if youre not going through a bad situation even just telling someone i love you before its too late even outside of a romantic relationship like family just telling people you love them and showing your love for anyone you love is very important because you never know it also feels good when someone says i love you or someone explains to you how they is definitely number one without trust theres no point you cant move forward i think trusting communication being honest which is again part of trusting i think its definitely something you have to take one step at a time i dont think there is something that you can put in chronological order to say right this is what we do and were going to take it off the checklist every one situation is completely different but trust i would say is the number one m a strong believer of when you go out searching for something you dont really find exactly what youre searching for because i think youre too concentrated on number one number two number three number fourall these different things that perfection doesnt exist so if you go out searching for something that you have to take off all these different boxes youre not going to find someone that takes off every single box because that just doesnt exist right when you dont look for it and it just kind of comes out of nowhere and surprises you it almost feels like all those boxes are ticked anyway even if theres something at the bottom of the list that isnt it but its just again the feeling of love i think love in general can definitely sweep you off your feet and thats why i say head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more its like you dont have to search anymore if you were searching you dont have to search anymore and even if you dont you dont have to search anymore because im not going if your heart stops beating you die you stop breathing you die and you no longer exist i feel like sometimes you can be so in love with someone or just infatuated with someone that you feel like if they leave what are you going to do like theres nothing left for me to do when of course there is but that feeling again is if i dont have you then i dont know how ill do with myself especially when you get so used to a situation as well and youre like this is what im used to ive been with you for however many years blah blah blah im used to this then all of a sudden for arguments sake again theyre not there then you feel like you might as well not be there either it can be very hard but were sticking to the positive side of love definitely think love is a drug its something that you can be so caught up on for so long and i think thats also why

forbid it doesnt work out in this situation the next person i find if theyre not showing me the same feelings and im not feeling the same way about them as i feel about you then im never going to get

what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started with me i get in

burger kang gucci gang dookie dang charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what i say give me donkey of the day what a way for to get underway but im gonna say everything that i wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite em in like a one a day im not done preach cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it cause the way i see people turnings makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they been pannin my album to death so i been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners,em has used similar metaphors on still dont give a fuck now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debti cant rap anymore i just murdered the alphabetand on im back where he rapsi murder a rhyme one word at a timealso notice the play on words with to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows and to rape the alpha bet i may raise some browseminem has never been afraid of criticizing himself throughout almost his entire career whether he be rapping about lying to his daughter about his drug problems on his song dj vu making lowquality music and not being able to live up to expectations on walk on water getting old and not knowing when to quit on the latter half of bad guy or failing to properly lead his former rap group d on stepping stoneeven his most popular critically acclaimed albums like the marshall mathers lp have received heavy criticism mostly due to profane lyrics which caused a lot of controversy eminem as seen throughout his career has no problem with crass lyrics and he knows that wont appeal to everyone and as he gets older and his fanbase declines partly due to his own volition he knows he cant be perfect but he can be honest and that is one of the things he believes hell be remembered people use the phrase new me killed the old me meaning their old ways are forgotten and no longer a part of their the phrase around eminem is suggesting that his old ways came back to take control of him once again which seems to be his more sadistic violent and pissed off slim shady alterego he thought he had gotten rid uses several examples to show that hes always got his eyes open including a play on words and a subject of continued eminem makes a play on the expression to nod off nodding off is an expression for falling asleep as the head slowly droops as someone loses consciousness mimicking a slow nod its noteworthy that nodding along to a beat doesnt necessarily mean that ones eyes are em claims that he doesnt even close his eyes when he sneezes most people close their eyes when they sneeze as an automatic reflex it is also a longstanding myth that ones eyes will pop out of their head if they were to sneeze with their eyes opencrest whitestrips are teeth whiteners that commonly irritate or cause increased sensitivity to ones gumsteeth so imagine how it must feel to have one jammed down ones dick with an ice pick em goes on to describe other ways to mutilate his genitals such as using a vise grip which essentially is a wrench that can tightly lock something in place in this instance ems dick on top of a spike fence pictured belowfrom the beginning of his career to present em has rapped about his own genital mutilation back in s the slim shady lp he raps on role modeli tie a rope around my penis and jump from a treeyou probably wanna grow up to be just like methese bars arent simply for gruesome shock value as em later goes on to explain hed rather endure such agony than hear you on a mic referring to the aforementioned mumble rappers earlier in the can use a nightclub a weapon to smash someone in addition having a nightclub on smash refers to be having a a good party also notice the implied pun with nightclub by the use of club and nightstickbefore modern medicine physicians would hold mirrors to the human mouth and look for fog to determine if a person was still evil spelled adlib was added in postproduction as a subtle jab towards critics who failed to notice some of the complex rhyme schemes from his album revival eminem addresses critics directly later in this track the adlib itself rhymes with evil spell and notes that he spelt out evil on this track em spoon fed listeners a pun in a similar fashionmaybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get item decides to rewind and slow down themedia meaty a line for the listeners since they dont necessarily have the comprehensive skills to understand the is also reflected earlier in the song when he rapscause you missed a line and never caught itcause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get itcause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartestem has been involved in several beefs throughout his career for example his beef with benzino and the source magazine in the early s the dispute eventually evolved to include all rappers from shady records and all rappers from benzinos crew made men well known tracks from the beef include benzinos pull your skirt up and die another day and ems the sauce and nail in the coffin where he attacked both the credibility of the source and benzinos rap notable feud was his beef with ja rule which he inherited after he signed cent to shady records ja mentioned ems daughter hailie on the track loose changeem you claim your mothers a crackheadand kim is a known slutso whats hailie gon be when she grows upthis led to ems brutal response on the track doe rae me hailies revenge which famously contributed to ending jas careerhailie what do you want to be when you grow up babyi dont know but i dont want togrow up to be like ja rules little dirtyass kids,intro plane crash yeah illa yo im just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me

hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased im eastside never be caught slippin now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats i dont even close my fuckin eyes when i sneeze aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage the thing aint even orangeoh my god thats a reach shout to all my colorblind people each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green aquamarine or you think water is pink dawg thats a date looks like an olive to

for to get underway but im gonna say everything that i wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite em in like a one a day im not done preach cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it cause the way i see people turnings makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they been pannin my album to death so i been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleanersem has used similar metaphors on still dont give a fuck now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debti cant rap anymore i just murdered the alphabetand on im back where he rapsi murder a rhyme one word at a timealso notice the play on words with to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows and to rape the alpha bet i may raise some browseminem has never been afraid of criticizing himself throughout almost his entire career whether he be rapping about lying to his daughter about his drug problems on his song dj vu making lowquality music and not being able to live up to expectations on walk on water getting old and not knowing when to quit on the latter half of bad guy or failing to properly lead his former rap group d on stepping stoneeven his most popular critically acclaimed albums like the marshall mathers lp have received heavy criticism mostly due to profane lyrics which caused a lot of controversy eminem as seen throughout his career has no problem with crass lyrics and he knows that wont appeal to everyone and as he gets older and his fanbase declines partly due to his own volition he knows he cant be perfect but he can be honest and that is one of the things he believes hell be remembered people use the phrase new me killed the old me meaning their old ways are forgotten and no longer a part of their the phrase around eminem is suggesting that his old ways came back to take control of him once again which seems to be his more sadistic violent and pissed off slim shady alterego he thought he had gotten rid uses several examples to show that hes always got his eyes open including a play on words and a subject of continued eminem makes a play on the expression to nod off nodding off is an expression for falling asleep as the head slowly droops as someone loses consciousness mimicking a slow nod its noteworthy that nodding along to a beat doesnt necessarily mean that ones eyes are em claims that he doesnt even close his eyes when he sneezes most people close their eyes when they sneeze as an automatic reflex it is also a longstanding myth that ones eyes will pop out of their head if they were to sneeze with their eyes opencrest whitestrips are teeth whiteners that commonly irritate or cause increased sensitivity to ones gumsteeth so imagine how it must feel to have one jammed down ones dick with an ice pick em goes on to describe other ways to mutilate his genitals such as using a vise grip which essentially is a wrench that can tightly lock something in place in this instance ems dick on top of a spike fence pictured belowfrom the beginning of his career to present em has rapped about his own genital mutilation back in s the slim shady lp he raps on role modeli tie a rope around my penis and jump from a treeyou probably wanna grow up to be just like methese bars arent simply for gruesome shock value as em later goes on to explain hed rather endure such agony than hear you on a mic referring to the aforementioned mumble rappers earlier in the can use a nightclub a weapon to smash someone in addition having a nightclub on smash refers to be having a a good party also notice the implied pun with nightclub by the use of club and nightstickbefore modern medicine physicians would hold mirrors to the human mouth and look for fog to determine if a person was still evil spelled adlib was added in postproduction as a subtle jab towards critics who failed to notice some of the complex rhyme schemes from his album revival eminem addresses critics directly later in this track the adlib itself rhymes with evil spell and notes that he spelt out evil on this track em spoon fed listeners a pun in a similar fashionmaybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get item decides to rewind and slow down themedia meaty a line for the listeners since they dont necessarily have the comprehensive skills to understand the is also reflected earlier in the song when he rapscause you missed a line and never caught itcause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get itcause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartestem has been involved in several beefs throughout his career for example his beef with benzino and the source magazine in the early s the dispute eventually evolved to include all rappers from shady records and all rappers from benzinos crew made men well known tracks from the beef include benzinos pull your skirt up and die another day and ems the sauce and nail in the coffin where he attacked both the credibility of the source and benzinos rap notable feud was his beef with ja rule which he inherited after he signed cent to shady records ja mentioned ems daughter hailie on the track loose changeem you claim your mothers a crackheadand kim is a known slutso whats hailie gon be when she grows upthis led to ems brutal response on the track doe rae me hailies revenge which famously contributed to ending jas careerhailie what do you want to be when you grow up babyi dont know but i dont want togrow up to be like ja rules little dirtyass kids,1.0

ooooooooooooooooooh bball for me yeah ooooooooooooooooooh ball for me what it tastes like ooooooooooooooooooh bball for me yeah,following the song concept nicki begins her verse impersonating malones lady who is waiting urgently for her man to come back from tourhit him on the jack is likely a wordplay that references the classic rb song hit the road jack by ray charles since post is on the road his lady can only contact him by hitting his phone and wonders how long will it take for the tour to accordance with the previous line here nicki implies that while bitches try to compete with her guys want to have sex with she refers to icethe slang term for diamond jewelry as she brags about receiving a lot of gifts from men trying to seduce her which explains the snow comparison this topic is also touched upon in rich sexi know what these niggas like and it aint my charmi aint stupid this on my armthough post doesnt seem to have a criminal history he expresses the love that his girl has for him due to her willingness to protect him whatever post has been charged or accused of the girl is willing to take the fall or face the consequences for the actions of someone charging foul in basketball terminology refers to when an offensive player charges into a defensive player who has already established themselves on the court usually knocking the defensive player over while not moving into the offensive players path considering the name of the song is ball for me its clear post was using drive is a street in beverly hills california known for being the host to many designer and luxury brand storefronts shops include saint laurent balenciaga gucci burberry louis vuitton and many more references to rodeo can be heard in the lyrics of many rappers including but not limited to kanye west savage and tyga this is not the first time malone has referenced rodeo most popularly in his single money made me do it featuring took the lincoln down rodeopost gives his girl to spend at the variety of stores on rodeo implies that if her significant other is a she is also a making them a perfect match it could also mean that she adds value to any man in her lifetend stresses the repetition of the number in the previous had a similar line recently on young thugs song anybodywhen i send that new bae alert niggas gon be madif you a i add attend to ya meaning if the guy shes with is a shell give him her claims to have spent on a car post is relatively quiet with regards to showing off his expensive purchases unlike some of his contemporaries however in march tmz reported that post got an old ford explorer restored increasing the formerly beatup suvs value by at least post reportedly had the idea to customize a explorer so he bought one for and sent it to west coast customs who customized also has a white rolls royce wraith which west coast customs also claims to have a watch on his wrist post has a collection of luxury watches including rolexes audemars piguets and

lady who is waiting urgently for her man to come back from tourhit him on the jack is likely a wordplay that references the classic rb song hit the road jack by ray charles since post is on the road his lady can only contact him by hitting his phone and wonders how long will it take for the tour to accordance with the previous line here nicki implies that while bitches try to compete with her guys want to have sex with she refers to icethe slang term for diamond jewelry as she brags about receiving a lot of gifts from men trying to seduce her which explains the snow comparison this topic is also touched upon in rich sexi know what these niggas like and it aint my charmi aint stupid this on my armthough post doesnt seem to have a criminal history he expresses the love that his girl has for him due to her willingness to protect him whatever post has been charged or accused of the girl is willing to take the fall or face the consequences for the actions of someone charging foul in basketball terminology refers to when an offensive player charges into a defensive player who has already established themselves on the court usually knocking the defensive player over while not moving into the offensive players path considering the name of the song is ball for me its clear post was using drive is a street in beverly hills california known for being the host to many designer and luxury brand storefronts shops include saint laurent balenciaga gucci burberry louis vuitton and many more references to rodeo can be heard in the lyrics of many rappers including but not limited to kanye west savage and tyga this is not the first time malone has referenced rodeo most popularly in his single money made me do it featuring took the lincoln down rodeopost gives his girl to spend at the variety of stores on rodeo implies that if her significant other is a she is also a making them a perfect match it could also mean that she adds value to any man in her lifetend stresses the repetition of the number in the previous had a similar line recently on young thugs song anybodywhen i send that new bae alert niggas gon be madif you a i add attend to ya meaning if the guy shes with is a shell give him her claims to have spent on a car post is relatively quiet with regards to showing off his expensive purchases unlike some of his contemporaries however in march tmz reported that

into those moments where you feel like you mess up and youre like well i already messed up so i might as well mess up more obviously thats not the answer but thats a real thing and feeling so i put it in my culture my dad was always that kind of guy who would always pay for everything i think i kind of took after my dad being more of the man and the guy i want to be around people that truly love me for who i am and arent around me and my lifestyle just to be in the vibe in the world and then like get free stuff all the time because usually thats the case nobody really shows up unless im like well im paying for the drinks and theyre like oh ok you know theyll be like no we cant come out i had a crazy week ahead im like im paying and theyll be like ok im there you got a table im comingalso as i started making more money in the music business i started seeing that more and more because people were like well you got money you should pay for everything well its like how about no its not even about buying me anything its about the thank you at the end when people start not even saying thank you anymore thats kind of disrespectful you know i tell my friends that i understand too my friends i always hook them up with tons of stuff but im like you dont need to get me something crazy i dont want a chanel bag but if you could buy me a coffee just like when you get coffee sometimes

for your love it aint newthis song was based on a story it was a whole bunch of things and there was a situation where it was unrequited love i was going through that but i didnt want to just make it all about laughing about yourself because i feel like some people may not be able to do that the one thing i feel like people could relate to universally is love and being rejected by love so i wanted to have a piece of that in there because i feel like sometimes love can make you feel that has helped me since i was younger i think that just having someone that you can talk to thats like not biased sometimes when you talk to your friends or your family they always want the best for you but sometimes its good to have somebody who is kind of out of it all and you can talk to them i tell a lot of my fans that too sometimes its really just about talking to someone even if you cant afford it or you dont have insurance or whatever it may be even if you could just talk to a friend that is better than nothing i think its mostly just being able to get your feelings out i think a lot of anger and sadness and pain and hurt comes from not being able to truly express how you feel i think that therapy is really me the song kind of embodies everything that i was feeling at this moment or in my life its like sometimes you gotta be sarcastic in life and be able to laugh at yourself or youre just gonna lose it so i was like ok well thats what my therapist says so im going to put it in there either people are going to listen to this song and be like this girl had a lot of issues or theyre going to be like no shes just like me i have issues but she is not afraid to say it i think everybody is a little crazy but some of us hide it better than others and we all have things going on in our think selflove is every thing when youre in a relationship with somebody i truly feel like its like taking a magnifying glass and not only putting it over the relationship but putting it over yourself so anything that you feel insecure about with yourself is going to come out in the relationship if youre insecure about trust issues or whatever it may be and i think that working on yourself is truly something really important and learning to love yourself and everybody says that but its the truth i think its like a daily try to be the best person i can for the first couple lines of the song it

and hardhearted mans perspectivefuck you and all your expectationsi dont even want your is why he states he is building his vision with a small percentage of people because he has decided from past experiences that the majority of people arent trustworthy kendrick also raps about this same feeling of skepticism on pridethis keep your circle small mentality is a recurring theme in hiphop tupac one of kendricks most noted influences is often credited with the saying the realest people dont have a lot of friendsthis also relates to the black panther film since the main protagonist tchalla had a small circle of people his trusted his sister shuri his love interest nakia and his friend feels that due to his fame people think they are entitled to his feels that the only person who is important is one who is the moral to the story meaning heshe has the solution to the problem that has been plaguing the world for centuries the lens of the mcu black panther is still a relatively new
