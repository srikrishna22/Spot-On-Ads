settle his scores drake goes down the block where his enemy was cut the lights so he isnt spotted and made his enemy pay the price in this case that enemy is kanye west who drake had a beef with when he recorded his parts of the song the price paid here is the loss of the alleged adidas deal that was ruined by kanye associate pusha ts diss track story of adidonfurther evidence supporting this theory is explained in this tweet which compares the location of drakes house to kanyes house may also be talking metaphorically about his entry in the rap game and his very successful career while paying the price for everything that comes with success such as intimacy and line could be referring to travis relationship with kylie jenner the couple went public in may of their use of facetime occurred during the nyc ksubi party in october the event celebrated the launch of travis scotts signature collection with the australian allegedly wants to come after kanye west as he is the reason why pusha t found out about drakes son and the adidas deal before drake could make the news public first hear about the news in pusha ts diss track called the story of adidon the budden speculation goes that drake came clean about it to kanye west while they were working on yes album together but then kanye backbit drake and told pusha t about it so he could use it in his diss track and expose travis scott is a producer for music kanyes record circle is a major street that runs through san fernando valley in los angeles it connects the valley to the affluent hidden hills community in

is your style your swag other rappers are taking babys philippe sa is a luxury swiss watch manufacturer their watches are some of the most expensive and hightier watches you can buy with prices ranging from around all the way up to million this is also why they are so often referred to in hiphop with lil baby himself referencing them for example in his song dates where he saysflooded pateek flooded patek whatever you call itif the ground in a public space is wet it is customary for the owners to put out a yellow caution sign such as thisgunna uses this ubiquitous wet floor sign as a metaphor to illustrate just how hard he drips that it spills out onto the floor and we need to be careful not to step in it and slip this is another reason not to stand too for atlanta producer dictionary defines backend as putting in work and getting paid for itlil baby references the amount of money he makes from an appearance by stating the fact he gets paid in all hundreds which leads the listener to rationalize its a lot of money hes getting paid for his foreign high fashion designer brands have become a staple of success and wealth in the rap game however given their origins gunna cant even begin to spell the brand names some examples of hardtopronounce brand names that hes rapped about in the past includeyves saint laurent the french high fashion label and name of young thugs record labelgivenchy another french brand known for its brand of haute couture a french brand known for its leather zanotti an designer italian shoe known for their luxury baby like many of his traprapping contemporaries hails from atlanta contemporary scene there is indeed very baby is signed to atlanta based record labelquality control music which counts amongst others migos on its roster all of the label signees are and contemporary of babys is also fellow atlanta rapper young thug whose ysl signee gunna also hails from atlanta and is gunna uses a double entendre by saying he doesnt want somebody else giving him a chain jewellery because hes rich enough to get one himself however slaves also used to wear chains which would be shackled to a slaves ankles this wouldve been profoundly is a french luxury brand identifiable by its logo of interlocking cs the retail price for chanel designer purses starts around lil baby interpolates the chorus to young thugs chanel go get it a song he was also featured on on the chorus young thug rapsshe want chanel go get it she want chanel go get itshe want this fendi go get it she want a birkin go get itlike thug baby is not concerned with the price tag when it comes to what his girl wants

there feeling so high but too far away to hold me you know im the one who put you up there name in the sky does it ever get lonely thinking you could live without me thinking you could live without me baby im the one who put you up there i dont know why yeah i dont know why,she probably helped someone she knew or likes become famous or just helped them live a sane life and they took advantage of being a hopeless romantic halsey seems to fail in all her relationships she previously documented her struggles in hopeless fountain kingdoms bad at loveim bad at lovebut you cant blame me for tryinyou know id be lyin sayinyou were the onethat could finally fix melookin at my historyit is also a reference to halsey and geazys tumultuous offagainonagain found her lover after he had seemingly just got his heart broken in his last relationship she attempts to help ease his pain by being constantly at his side in an interview halsey revealed that she once made an attempt at suicide while in high schooli had tried to kill myself i was an adolescent i didnt know what i was doing because i was i was still in a childrens ward which was terrifying i was in there with yearolds who had tried to kill briefly explained the meaning behind this in the halsey without me interview with zane lowei think its the only thing that ive experienced in the past couple years that made me put my phone down and say i dont care what they think in a weird way this relationship has been the most liberating thing thats ever happened to me because it made me put my phone down and go i dont care what you think cause this makes me happyin short halsey uses this to say that she couldnt care less what people have to say about her relationship she doesnt care if they laugh because it is what is making her happy and thats whats most important at the end of the is stating that if her exlovers attitude wont relent then he can live without uses this same style of songwriting where she repeats the same phrase in between lines in her song eyes closednow if i keep my eyes closed he looks just like youbut hell never stay they never donow if i keep my eyes closed he feels just like youbut youve been replacedin may halsey and geazy split this song encompasses her feelings on her romantic relationship and her relationshiplife being exposed to the s statement to the public readi normally keep this kind of thing private but provided our public nature i feel the need to inform my fans geazy and i are taking some time apart im eager to continue the upcoming passage of time dedicating myself to my art and my career and the duration of my tour i wish him the best thanks for respecting our privacy at this timehalsey elevated her man to godstatus placing him on a pedestal above everything else this theme is mirrored in another of her songs young goddo you feel like a young godby using future tense halsey knew they would lose their godlike status one day and become mortals again when their love fades away however she never knew that she would lose that status while he remains regrets how much she gave to her significant other only to be left alone in the end its similar to thoughts she expressed on s lettersand now i cant stop thinking that i cant stop thinkingthat i almost gave you everythingand now the whole things finished and i cant stop wishingthat i never gave you anythingthis line may also allude to the famous bible verse psalm where king david acknowledges that god gives him an abundance of wealth and blessingsyou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup could be talking about her relationship with geazy both artists often mention doing drugs for example on november s him i featuring halsey geazy singswe do drugs together fuck up clubs togetherdemons or struggles are a repeated theme throughout halseys music especially on her debut album badlands which released in august on the song control she saysim meaner than my demonsand on hold me downmy demons are begging me to open up my mouthi need themfollowing badlands release she even did an interview with billboard and discussed her bipolar disorder another one of her track may mark halseys return to her darker roots instead of the more radiofriendly pop fare of her june album hopeless fountain interpolates a lyric from justin timberlakes hit cry me a river which is centered around his breakup with britney spearson cry me a river timberlake singsyou dont have to say what you didi already know i found out from himmedia outlets mistakenly labeled this as a

and landing inside my grave i know that you want me dead i take prescriptions to make me feel aokay i know its all in my head i have these lucid dreams where i cant move a thing thinking of you in my bed you were my everything thoughts of a wedding ring now im just better off dead ill do it over again i didnt want it to end i watch it blow in the wind i shouldve listened to my friends leave this shit in the past but i want it to last you were made outta plastic fake i was tangled up in your drastic ways who knew evil girls had the prettiest face you gave me a heart that was full of mistakes i gave you my heart and you made heart break bridge you made my heart break you made my heart ache i still see your shadows in my room you made my heart break you made my heart ache cant take back the love that i gave you you made my heart break were made outta plastic fake you made my heart ache i still see your shadows in my room you made my heart break again i was tangled up in your drastic ways who knew evil girls had the prettiest face chorus i still see your shadows in my room cant take back the love that i gave you its to the point where i love and i hate you and i cannot change you so i must replace you oh easier said than done i thought you were the one listenin to my heart instead of my head you found another one but i am the better one i wont let you forget me i still see your

one listenin to my heart instead of my head you found another one but i am the better one i wont let you forget me outro leave this shit in the past but i wanted to last you were made outta plastic fake i was tangled up in your drastic ways who knew evil girls had the prettiest face easier said than done i thought you were instead of my head you found another better one i wont let you forget me,thats a false statement ive come to find out i feel like maybe in tv its somewhat real cause you know how in the movies where the high school bully girls they be all like dumb blondes everybody be trying to get with them at school and they be like get the fuck out my face you know what im saying but i think in real life thats not necessarily can see whats goin on from the outside way better than you can see when you looking straight ahead youre the one thats in the shit they can see all the faults cause i feel like when you feel a certain type of way about someone or something you dont see anything wrong with paralysis i have it to this day if somethings bothering me i have it if im going through stress and shit i have it its still the same feeling as it was when it first started still the same amount of fear it does not get old its scary you can be laying right next to somebody and if they not paying attention they wont even know you having it some people have it together thats crazy its a documentary on netflix where the husband was having it he saw a cat sitting on his wifes chest and when she was having it she saw something leaning over him they was crying when they was talking about it but it was scary as remember pill popping wasnt cool now everybody want some pcp like what the fuckthat was just me being a victim of whats goin on but i was one of them people that was doing it when it wasnt cool so its not even awesome hoping on any type of wave it was really a scapegoat it was really a scapegoat it fucked everything up fucked everything up any help that was given by that was very temporary wasnt anything it didnt permanently fix anything it was very temporary like four or five hours of feeling like shit was gonna be okay and after that your deeper than the hole you were before and then you gotta take more cause your tolerance is built up and now you on twice three times four times and before you know it your like dead but i guess where music is today people just popping pills is the new weed overdosing is the new high its fucked kind of figured out that i probably dont know what real love is nine times out of ten i dont but i feel like if you have an attachment to somebody if you feel strong about somebody why would you want to cut them out of your life its always you got sleep paralysis you see things that possibly are there or they arent there you see shadows some people have an old lady that sits on their chest they call it the old hag and its weird cause like a hundred million people probably have sleep paralysis and a lot of them see the same old lady sitting on theyre chest that shits crazy but the shadows thats pretty much talking about sleep paralysisits to the point where i love and i hate youthats one of the craziest things i feel like a lot more people go through it than people think cause i mean you could be attached to somebody thats no good and you cant help your feeling at the end of the day its like you know that theyre not good and that goes for anything even outside of a boyfriend or girlfriend relationship that goes with friendships in the family all types of shit people gotta love their family at the end of the day but some people got some no good ass family members so i feel like you can reach that point on any is a recording studio thats the one i used to record at i used to go two hours at a time and if i had like a little bit of money stashed up i would go for six hours i would either buy a two hour or six hour nothing more nothing less they put a tag at the beginning of the songs they mix its pretty cool its different thats enviyon in the is a recording studio thats the one i used to record at i used to go two hours at a time and if i had like a little bit of money stashed up i would go for six hours i would either buy a two hour or six hour nothing more nothing less they put a tag at the beginning of the songs they mix its pretty cool its different thats enviyon in the

also be taken as a direct line towards pusha t and the enduring and highprofile beef these two have had for a long released duppy freestyle in response to pusha ts infrared in which he replies to pusha ts criticisms by comparing their commercial and financial successes in pusha ts infamous response track the story of adidon pusha never counters the comments drake made about the comparison of their success financially and or commercially hes implying that since pusha t has nothing to say against drakes claim of more success he has to change the topic altogether and resort to lowblows against him as a drake had a turbulent hes still putting out january he dropped gods plan which went x platinum he followed this up with his th studio album scorpion which spawned two number singles with nice for what and in my feelingshowever drakes album rollout was interrupted by an escalation of the long simmering beef with pusha t which also roped in kanye west who drake appears to also mention in this pusha undoubtedly pressured drake scorpion was still a commercial success hitting number and being certified platinum as of late the reference to writing might also be a nod to the well documented ghostwriting accusations that once again came up in the beef with pusha drake is likely suggesting that while his success story is unbelievable no one could write it its unlikely that

tells us that he buys a pair of shoes or orders to kill with the same ease and for the same price while making fun of the the ganster slang youngins means young ones in several thugganster lifestyles young people are used to carry out criminal activities because they get better legal treatment avoiding jail in some likely a nod to drakes love for wearing hooded also drops in a subtle shout out to his loyal girl who he references further down in his she held it down so she got a mercedesthis is most likely drake reflecting on his early days in the music he first started in music drake was a signee to birdmans ymcmb and though he still in part represents the label fast forward a few years and drake owns one of the most popular record labels and collectives in his time ovo octobers very own ovo has a hand in fashion music radio and even has its very own annual at first he took what he was given but now he is the one giving out opportunities and making decisions for drake has had his fair share of beef over the years his loyal friends and label mates which he had around from his early days in toronto canada are still working with him till this notably drakes producer and engineer and genius noah shebib who has been working with drake since the beginning of has echoed similar lyrics about his loyalty to his friends over industry personnel in his pm in new york freestyle in off his if youre reading this its too late albumim managed by my friends that i grew up withid rather give that to people i fuck withlil baby briefly explained this lyric in his breakfast club interview by saying that after he nuts she needs to leave so he can sleep however he confirmed he was currently in a relationship and that this mindset was one of his older lifelil babys breakfast club interview explaining this is available on song made it to lil babys debut album harder than ever and with first week sales it was projected to reach anywhere between kk there is no doubt that the collaboration with drake was the catalyst for these impressive people refer to this reaction as the drake effect where drakes mention cosign or feature increases the popularity and sometimes sales of the subject in question examples include the increase in streams of the artist giggs after his feature on drakes more life playlist in from acting to music drake has been grafting for a very long time and as a result his life is winning awards to buying italian and german cars dominating billboard charts breaking spotify records and an estimated net worth of million dollars drakes quality of life is arguably above is stating that it should be because he put in the work for it its well baby shouts out his jewish lawyer mentioning his high price and implicitly highlighting his greed a common stereotype of jews he says that his lawyers skill is as astonishing as voodoo a type of magic he isnt the first rapper to shout out their jewish lawyers following suit of jayz drake and aap ferg

american sportswear brand claiming he doesnt wear chanel when doing roadin the uk especially london waps is a short way of saying weapons and is seen as a gun rather than any other weapon he is likely referring to this since it would keep with the theme of doin road which again has southlondon example of this is seen with uk drill group who have a song called waps in which they repeatedly refer to

picture mona lisa mona lisa yeah,proposed suggestionwayne is looking for the moneykendrick has dipped into the perspective of the male in this relationship he begins the verse as a narrator which creates a greater psychic distance as he is telling this story with the shift into this perspective kendrick increases the psychic distance and changes his voice literally as he raps as well as the voice of the character in the story he is telling this signifies the perspective technique is comparable to what eminem does in the song stanhummingbirds make short soft calls created by the rapid beating of their wings this could be referencing how quickly they began their romance when she asked him to have sex on the ride home making love in a taxi or on the ride home shows a rush into romance like the rapid humming of a talking about a yellow taxi could be a reference to the joni mitchell classic big yellow taxi in which a big yellow taxi takes the main characters girl away this links to the song as she falls quickly for someone bigger than him and is taken spill the beans is to reveal secret information unintentionally or indiscreetly this links to the next line regarding her dishonesty matching the songs theme in switches to the point of view of the man whos girl is cheating on him he found out that she had sex with someone else and is shocked that she would even try to hide it from him he claims to always find out when someone is messing with character is making a new religion to worship this girl as she is poetry in motion graceful and beautiful the fruit tree in many religions and cultures is representative of fertility and physical nourishment most famously used in the story of adam and eve and the tree of life an apple tree instead of an apple kendrick uses the pear tree perhaps alluding to the feminine is blindly obsessed with this deceitful woman mona lisa the musical arrangement in the background of this section portrays the feeling of euphoric love for this woman that the character is not concerned with hurting this guys feelings he is as carefree as a dog holding his head out of a car window feeling the breeze his lack of concern doesnt make him any less of a threat to this man though a pitbull laughing is still a lie through your teeth is to offer a blatant lie just as a cavity lies in your teeth however a cavity is also a hole through which the lie may pass through fillings are used to fill cavities tells the mark to put his hands up in a threatening manner after he complies weezy then tells liz to put her hands down since she is in on the setup she has nothing to fear the jig is upits also worth noting that weezy says liz thats enough before telling her that she can put her hands down this shows that liz is so committed to the charade that only weezy himself can tell her to stop this also supports weezys earlier declaration that the women who run this schemes for him will do whatever he says

an ideal life without heavy drug thats not the case hes simply a drug addict who wants even more of whatever hes on for an improved high this could also be simpler than that and simply mean that he needs one more than one dose to feel the high hence needing two pills opposed to lines vague detail leaves it up for debate but due to the portrayal of symptoms of depression through the album it could simply be a doctor recommending a higher dose of antidepressants of some this line juice most likely is saying that hes wrong for taking drugs but hes not wrong for liking them this is caused by the tendency of many drugs to have an addictive nature such as marijuana and xanax they also tend to make the user feel like hes in a euphoric state upon taking certain drugs which is why he thinks its correct to enjoy popping pills and lighting blunts they do tend to have negative side effects that last an entire lifetime which could also be part of why he thinks hes wrong for doing rappers including huge names like our fallen xxxtentacion and living rappers such as lil xan lil pump and many others probably feel the same way this is because they all admit to doing drugs lil xan went as far as to name himself after xanax and lil pump made a cake out of xanax its safe to say hes not alone on this also relates to this topic about iconic and controversial peopleespecially rappers dying young on his tribute song to xxxtentacion and lil peep titled legendsall legends fall in the makingsorry truth dying young demon youthboth of the rappers referred in the song died near the high point

hair tied up hey hey hey they were changed to fit with little mixs image because the song was originally written for jess official lyrics depict a more glamorous partying woman whereas the demo shows a more casual laidback is no secret that many other females in the game would want to be as successful as nicki and attempt to copy her her song barbie tingz dives deeper into that topic as she

her put a rude boy is a mischievous or obscene guy in jamaican slangderrire derives from the french word for behind and is commonly used as a synonym for buttknotted up can be interpreted in a few different one it is a reference to the phrase to tie the knot which is used for when two people get married what shes saying is that she married the guy because he could afford to buy her jewels and diamonds ice her she engages further with the idea of only giving rich men a chance on her promotional single rich sex featuring lil wayne on which she rapsdont let homie fuck unless his bands uprich sexgo to dr get that fat transferrich sexit aint such a thing as broke and handsomerich sexif you let that broke nigga fuck we tellinrich sexsecondly the expression is homophonous with the phrase knot

yeah,sometimes it just feels like you are just surrounded and you just feel like youre surrounded with good love or bad love like i said this song can be interpreted so many different ways so the way i wrote it was obviously from a sense of this is not necessarily a bad situation its almost too good so im trying to make it bad to protect myself if that makes sense i think a lot of us do that in a lot of cases but it could mean anything trippin it could mean anything but for me its basically when you feel like its too good to be true and youre tryna make sure that you dont get hurt because im very definitely feel like love can feel like a drug sometimes sometimes you feel like if youre not getting back the same love that youre putting in youre withdrawn almost and you just feel like you need it and sometimes you cant put your finger on what exactly it is about it or about the person that makes you love them so much sometimes you cant understand and i think thats why sometimes people stay in bad relationships and thats why good relationships last so long it can be both sides of the spectrum definitely have been a situation where i felt like this might be too good to be true and you kind of take a backseat and its like maybe i should chill out but then again again in the sense of what the song is i come to find out that i was just making myself believe that because at the end of the day sometimes its not too good to be true sometimes it really can be a real love you knowif you go through the verse and then go through the prechorus its almost like ive created this situation in my head that somethings happening or ive put this wall up because of whats happened to me before and im kind of expecting you to do the same thing so the chorus is a moment of realization of being like wait i have to give everyone an even playing field and be like this is actually me im making something up that doesnt exist so im done trippinso this is the interesting part because everyone thinks i said its just too bitter for words but we were using a play on when you get married its actually worse when you get married you say for better or for worse right in wedding vows right so thats just too bitter for worse dont wanna taste it is as in imagine if youre getting married to someone and they say for better or for worse but were using better as bitter because this is a bitter situation so it was kind of a play on words i dont think anyone got but its fine because i love think those are actually my favorite lines of the song because especially me im a big lover like i have a lot of love to give im a very loving person and i would hate to give it to someone who doesnt deserve it or i feel like isnt really giving it back to me and yeah i think if you think about running a marathon youve put all of this training in youve put all of this working out eating well like preparing yourself for this marathon and you get to the marathon and you do k of that k and then you just collapse or something gets in your way and you no longer can do the extra k or the last k that youre supposed to do and its like all of that effort all of that preparation that youve put in to not make it to where your end goal was thats frustrating i feel like its the same in the sense of putting time and effort and loving someone to not get there in the end that just makes everything not worth it

limbo place where youve broken up but someone keeps opening the door up a little bit and you come back in its all very messy and that relates to someone pushing you away as well its empty promises being made to someone when in reality something else is happening behind the scenes that you might not have seen and you just kind of find was based off those really youthful and naive promises you make the first time that you might have fallen in love its like you really do make those promises and you dont understand the depth or the actual commitment that youre speaking of the power of the words when you use them for the first time like weapons so its like for me it was something that i really didnt understand and something that ive said to someone in the past and they had said things to me as well and that lyric represents the naivety of using words that you dont fully comprehend singer puts their all into the relationship whereas their partner doesnt care this could be seen as unrequited love when the love between two people only comes from one of the pair from the lines above this also shows that the other person isnt making this separation easy and is clearing being difficult about s someone being with other people or a person behind youre back and thinking that no one can like theses schmucks cant take my place or whatever yeah i mean on a literal term its just yeah youre oblivious of what was happening behind youre back and you want to kind of know that now you know that they should kind of feel bad about it and i hope that you see my face instead of theirs or whatever which is kind of weird but you know its obviously in a dark definitely the use of the word crawl was like what it feels defeated it feels like youre coming s just that power that the person has over you and youre a puppet to them youll do whatever just to retrieve the feeling that you think is important or best for you because you dont know whats best for you i guess so its the powerlessness youre fragile and your kind of at this persons every beck and call and i think thats a lyric of frustration and s always going to be a little different for everyone in the band but youngblood for me is a way that we were living at the time were writing it and also youngblood is a person whose persona is very on and off push and give and take and all that kind of good stuff its such a visual word you can visualize the feelings of the word as well and i think that always is what connected with me about that lyric and especially how strong it strikes in the chorus as this being kind of like an allencompassing thing of what is youngblood thats what i think is so cool about the song its like even when we were playing it live the other night it didnt feel like the somber depressing moment it felt like this empowering kind of piece of music that makes you feel something and its so diverse in what it stands for and what it means and i think thats why its managed to connect the way it has because i feel like no matter how you look at it theres still some sort of relevance you can find in your life to the actual music thats happening in the prechorus feels like tension and it does feel like pushing and pulling and i think thats one of the parts that i like in this song as well the lyric binds really well with the tension that builds in the prechorus of youngbloodthose lyrics are kind of in that limbo place where youve broken up but someone keeps opening the door up a little bit and you come back in its all very messy and that relates to someone

picked up all my ways i feel responsible they tryna say that all my problems is improbable they keep itching at my spit im diabolical ya feel me,these chants may be a nod to gasoline dreams from outkasts album stankonia where andr shouts alright times in a similar is an inspiration for travis among many the two even collaborated on the ends a track from scotts previous album birds in the trap sing mcknighta reference to the overall theme of the song and the album astronomy is a science that attempts to explain phenomena that are not fully known to man for example galaxies planets and stars the concepts of both stargazing and astroworld can be linked back to this science it could also be a way for travis to explain how this current album is something that we have never seen before and do not understand therefore requiring research and reference to the bloods a gang founded in los angeles california they are primarily known for the use of their red signature color and their longstanding rivalry with the crips another gang from in this sense throwing up bs might allude to bands instead of the bshaped gang sign that the bloods lines tie back to the purpose of stargazing while it is mainly descriptive of a bad trip travis here introduces what impelled him to take the psychedelics in the first place his life has been changing quite has gained large amounts of success from his mixtape days through his massively popular debut album rodeo then birds in the trap sing mcknight and now his longawaited lp astroworld in the meantime hes gone from being a relatively unknown artist to starting a relationship with one of the worlds biggest models kylie jenner its not unlikely that for someone whose life changed so quickly travis would have wanted an escape from it all hence the impetus to segue contains similar animalistic howling heard on wolves a track off kanye wests the life of pablowolves is a deep reflection of west on his relationship with kim kardashian and she appears in the tracks music video a balmain advert scotts use of a similar sound may be an allusion to west and their shared connection to the kardashianjenner six flags corporation made the final decision to close astroworld to provide more parking spaces for when the houston texans would play at relient stadium six flags corp fell short by half of their expected earnings in selling the property making it unprofitable to relocate the amusement park since then the property has been used to host musical festivals and other events as a local artist travis likely performed at the site with childhood memories of the april kylie jenner rented out the entire california six flags theme park for a night to give travis an astroworld themed surprise party in attendance were travis and kylies friends and family including kanye travis made good on his promise to relocate and bring back astroworld to the people close to him even if it was just for one interpolates the lines from biggies mo money mo problems and drakes energy line i got enemies got a lot of enemiesby definition the word amenity could refer to a useful feature or facility of a building or place which goes along with his metaphor of living on the top floor of a building it can also refer to the pleasantness of a person travis uses a doubleentendre to describe how taxing societal expectations can bebooger sugar is a slang term for cocaine excessive use of the drug can cause your nose to term likely evolved from the pet name sugar booger a term of endearment one would call a close friend or family kicks off this line by describing his past life before fame and stardom the houston rapper spent his childhood years together with his grandmother who lived in the hood which scott elaborated on in a interview with complexi was born in houston texas i grew up in houston by missouri city its like a suburb in the area its middleclass but i used to stay with my grandma in the hood from ages one to the same interview travis explained some of the traumatizing scenes he witnessed while living in poor circumstancesgrowing up my grandmother stayed in the hood so i seen random crazy shit i saw mad

the youtube live release party for pray for the wicked that the chorus for high hopes was the first chorus written for the albumthe chorus was given to me by a friend named ilsey she had this whole idea and the perfect message it felt just how i wanted to iterate to people about my childhood making cardboard cutouts of guitars and acting like a rock people have interpreted this lyric to mean that pray for the wicked will be the last panic at the disco album brendon urie addressed this idea in an interview with nme expressing his desire to continue panic for a long timewhen writing the lyric i didnt take it that way but who knows im so impulsive i could say that this will never be the last but i dont know whats going to happen tomorrow i dont have any plans to stop ever anytime soon i want to be like mick jaggers age and still doing it thats the dreama prophecy isthe foretelling or prediction of what is to comefulfilling a prophecy means to make a prediction come lyrics hint at the idea that brendon was destined to do something great that he should look to fulfill the prophecy that had been set out for at the discos introduction into and approach within the music industry has been far from one of the first bands to garner recognition and success through the internet they were nonconformists in an industry with deeprooted conventions and expectations and instead of having little commercial success they took the world by storm as stranger crusadersthroughout commercial radios musical eras characterized by the dominance of hip hop and pop panic has always opted for the weird and the novelties instead notably switching from the pop punk and vaudevillian theatrics of their debut a fever you cant sweat out to the flower crowns and beatlesinspired psychedelic and baroque pop of their sophomore album pretty odd panic takes pride in their label as odditiesby following their own interests and disregarding the pressure of their contemporaries panic established a precedent of never giving up in environments that only seem to ostracize them and of never changing themselves at the expense of their quirks and brendon urie and panic at the discos career the band has continually changed genre and shifted the status quo from the s inspired psychedelia of pretty odd to the electronic club synths of too weird to live too rare to die panic has delved into a new sound with each some may believe that panic has done everything that is possible for a band to do brendon urie believes that only the best is yet to come for panicthe phrase but they havent seen the best of me is also reminiscent of a lyric in this is gospel which states but they havent seen the best of us yetmuseum victories refers to paintings of battles that are often housed in art museums rulers or military officers would often commission artwork to commemorate their great victories these works of art are typically over the top in their depictions portraying the victors as shining striving for museum victories urie continues the theme of seeking out the very best in everything that he does achieving goals so great that they deserve to have commemorative paintings commissioned in their singleton copley the death of major peirson the manifest destiny was a belief held by thcentury american settlers that it was their godgiven right or destiny to settle westwardmanifest destiny in the context of high hopes refers to the view that brendon was destined to be a musician and share his craft with the progress by john gast is an allegorical representation of the modernization of the new the early days of panic at the disco the band had very little money only big passions and dreams in music their lack of funds can be especially noted in their first album and most notably in their single i write sins not tragediesin an interview on the zach sang show brendon sharedwe had ten thousand dollars to do the first album we had like no money at that point we couldnt even get an extra two hundred dollars to pay someone in to come and play trumpet we had to pay a sixth grader to come in and play trumpet and we recorded each note separately so if you listen to i write sins not tragedies first single off first album we recorded a girl who was you know years old playing cello one note at a time and we just took them and sampled them basically played it like an mpc so we actually did that like by hand it was really having little money to keep their band and themselves personally afloat their vision of achieving success was enough to sustain line also calls back to a similar lyric in fuck a silver liningwas lost in thought but held my visionthis lyric refers to brendon possibly being overwhelmed or lost but ultimately remaining set on his biography is a work of writing that outlines a persons experiences and includes intimate details of their biography mentioned in the lyrics can easily be equated to panics discography throughout panics career they have continually burned and rewritten themselves each album has been a completely different genre from the s style of pretty odd to electronic club beat of too weird to live too rare to die this genre fluidity has caused some fans of their music to come and go however panic has continually abandoned the status quo and created music that has spoken to them

when you finish too latewhen a human starts to die their body temperature decreases typically the person will mention feeling coldthe nowiconic evil laugh for movie villains a sinister laugh has become a signal of something evil happening often an evil laugh ends the song on a surprising and unnerving note hinting that the thriller will come for the music video a surprise twist reveals michaels werewolf eyes are staring at the camera vincent laughs as this evil michael glances at the camera the screen freezes and the credits this point in the song its tone changes while in the earlier verses the songs tone is more menacing and horrific describing terrors in chilly details implying that michael is the terrifying entity and an antagonist of this thriller scene this shift in the tone now portrays michael as the girls savior it is a common element of thriller movies to have a female protagonist who is the target of a horrifying threat and for her to have a male love interest which many times saves her in the final the video accompanying this song michael plays the suitor of two girls first in the video inside the video and reality he also plays two monsters a werewolf in the video within the video and a zombie in real lifereferring to the way rotting bodies the thriller music video corpses begin to crawl out of the ground in a graveyard at this part of the song michael now also being one of the zombies and the rest of them surround his date as she shakes in fear in the center of the circle of classic thriller relies on darkness to make the story or movie scary with no light but the moon we feel closer to our primitive state when humans were just another scared animal in a dangerous examples are dracula wolfman and many of the grimm fairy tales when jackson and rod temperton wrote thriller they had probably recently seen halloween friday the th or the comedyhorror an american werewolf in london another classic horror trope the wildly popular film alien had come out three years prior to this song much todo was made of the creatures horrifying jawsand of course aliens were the subject of many a scary movie in prior decades toothe reanimated gathering at a ball is a classic horror s an image from carnival of souls a zombie filmhorror movies are always hyping the number of eyes the monster number is being used as a placeholder for the

chorus yeah you bet i know that she aint never give a single fuck about me yeah you bet she know that we aint never gonna be together i see yeah you bet i go to see you when im feeling like a drum without a beat yeah you dance so good and i think thats kinda neat verse what you know about love what you know about life what you know about blood bitch you aint even my type yeah right yeah right yeah you know i feel right yeah you living right now you dont ever pick sides yeah right yeah right im overthinking my pride but i dont gotta look nice she just feelin my ice she just feelin my chorus and you bet i know that she aint never give a single fuck about me yeah you bet she know that we aint never gonna be together i see yeah you bet i go to see you when im feeling like a drum without a beat yeah you dance so good and i think thats kinda neat,someone once told me a long time ago that like youre not loyal to shit you dont have any sides you dont stand on any side on anything you just skate the line that was because at that time i didnt care about anything i was just living a very wake up blah blah blah and substance abuse whatever once youre in a numbed state you just dont pick sides its like why would you even pick sides when you can just be on your own and do your own once told me a long time ago that like youre not loyal to shit you dont have any sides you dont stand on any side on anything you just skate the line that was because at that time i didnt care about anything i was just living a very wake up blah blah blah and substance abuse whatever once youre in a numbed state you just dont pick sides its like why would you even pick sides when you can just be on your own and do your own do you know about family and what do you know about true values of friendship because if youre here with me surely you cant have great values and by me i mean not me but the character of the songbitch you aint even my type is a moment of realization its like i know that its like youre not even my type but like i said i dont mean the way i see life is like noones special youre not born special if youre lucky youre given a certain set of skills and a certain set of resources and you run with them and then everyone dies so as long as they know that and theyre not thinking in a gods plan sort of way cause its like why is god only looking out for one person thats stupid its not in your favor all the time so just stuff like that thats what i would assume like do you know whats happening right now do you understand that its flesh i dont dont mind this whole thing going on you gotta keep in mind of that so when youre just lonely if shes available as with like a filthy old man youll still go to see her when youre feeling like a drum without a beat even though you know that youre giving out and doing all this and s very obvious that she does not see a future or she doesnt want to be with me in any sort of way in any other given definitely know when someone doesnt give a fuck about you when theyre not checking you at all i feel like if theyre very indifferent but theyre just like to everything you say youre like is this a good thing is this a bad thing theyre like yeah yeah whatever oftentimes people that dont care theres different types but in this sense if were talking about these lyrics i would think the girl is literally just using this guy i know i said there are no pronouns but there totally are im would say they dont give a fuck when they become indifferent because if theyre mad and theyre still interacting with you then they still care obviously but if theyre not interacting at all and theyre just kind of going along with everything you do then if youre not rich then theyre just indifferent if you do have something to offer to them they would just stick around but still be person doesnt mind because the selfhatred has already been established this is a person thats way past selfhatred someone whos already very honest with themselves and theyre like look it could be just a person and their significant other in a room together or just the thought of them being in a relationship or something and its like listen i know im not getting any younger this is this and that you hit an age youre like yeah well i mean this is like i got this this is great for now if it doesnt turn out to be great its whatever but this is what i have now and i dont think im gonna find anything much better so im gonna stick to this and i dont mind because its not destructive its not productive but its not s how a lot of people get stuck i feel like in relationships and also just life in general theyre just getting comfortable and this person whos singing this song doesnt mind the lifestyle of just you know being with girls with the bottles and stuff thats cool too im like that every now and then she dont care if i die its like ima fuck up my life and were gonna party all night so ive introduced that were partying and were having a good time but this chick once again adding to the fucking song topic she doesnt care if i die i could fall over in the club right now and have a heart attack and youd probably run or something or not who am i to judge but i wouldnt trust you as a hospital contact or anything i think ima stick to yeah yeah someone else but you know thats still like she doesnt care if i die im dancing with this chick or im with this chick and she doesnt care if i die

giving or selling ones soul for untold riches success or immortality is as ancient as the bible maybe touches on this concept in his bonus track my darlingyou sold your soul to me need i remind youyou remember that night you prayed to godyoud give anything to get a record deal well dre signed youthis is what you wanted your whole life marshall right oohlook at this house look at these cars theyre so nice woooh but you didnt know fame has a price tooin the above example eminems slim shady alterego takes on a seemingly demonic formgoing so far as to suggest that even while praying to god the answer to ems selfish request came in the form of dr dres record deal he elaborated on this idea in a line from s not alike one that was also appropriately aimed at machine gun kellypunk you dont disrespect ogs prodigysold dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed methat ill be the most hated though made itso that theres no shame its okay to own ithere with killshot eminem implies that the level of success he was able to achieve in his lifetime is not only something machine gun kelly will never experience but it is so outside the realm of possibility that mgk would paradoxically be willing to die for labels machine gun kelly as his son in the opening bars of the song and he continues this metaphor by calling mgk his offspringthese lines correspond with other mgk disses from kamikaze specifically on the song not alikei respond rarely but this time shady bout to sound offlike a fuckin cocked semiglock demigodlet me put a fuckin silencer on this little nonthreatening blond fairy cornball takin shots at meem is aware that he is giving mgk undeserved attention telling someone to lick a gun barrel or eat a gun is another way of telling them to commit interpolates the chorus from mgks rap devilim sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats lets talk about itim sick of you bein rich and you still mad lets talk about iteminem is also grouping mgk with mumble rappers because of his use of autotune mumble rap is an informal name for new era hiphop eminem expresses his disdains for it on tracks like august s the ringer he also suggests mgk is mumbling because hes literally got his mouth declared himself an alien on january s chloraseptic remixits cause im an alien thats why i write til the page is outta spacehe calls mgk a satanist since he named his diss track rap devil the title of the diss track is a play on one of ems most popular hits rap god the devil or satan is considered to be the antithesis of line also connects with in vain in the previous line a religious phrase found in the ten commandmentsthou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in is a direct response to mgks line on rap devil where he statesyeah ill acknowledge youre the goatbut im the gunner bitch i got you in the scope brradont have a heart attack now nosomebody help your mans up helpknees weak of old age the real slim shady cant stand uphowever em is ten years sober and believes his exercising makes a heart attack unlikely ironically the original machine gun kelly died of a heart the next few lines em establishes a connection to lyrics from the final verse of stan this line is structurally very similar to the line that precedes the starter cap linelook im really flattered you would call your daughter thatmachine gun kelly references a line from eminems track my dads gone crazy during the opening verse of rap devili think my dads gone crazy yeah hailie you rightdads always mad cooped up in the studio yellin at the micem takes on the title of mgks father and responds with a callback to his hit song stanmgk has been very public about how big of an eminem fan he is rap devil mgk says hes willing to get violent with eminemor we could get gully ill size up your bodyand put some white chalk around it eyeminem plays on run up to mean both to confront someone with violence and to increase the cost of an expense in this case a phone and animals play dead in order to avoid being attacked by predators em also uses still to imply steel a synecdochic slang term for a firearm thus responding to a line on rap devil where mgk claimed he was aiming a firearm at himbut im the gunner bitch i got you in the scope brrathis also plays off mgks lineseven punches to your face hold your head stillin his interview with sway eminem mentioned not wanting to give any more shine to machine gun kelly while still feeling the desire to respond to rap devilnow im in this fucking weird thing because im like i gotta answer this motherfucker and every time i do that it makes that personas irrelevant as people say i am in hiphopi make them bigger by getting into this thing where im like i want to destroy him but i also dont want to make him biggerem expressed a similar sentiment on the ringeryou mention me millions of views attention in newsi mention you

she has cried so much she doesnt want to cry anymore saying that there are no more tears in her body is a figure of speech saying that that is physically impossible so shes saying that she no longer wants to cry or that she just is referring to the lgbtq community comin out even though the society is against you rainin down in this verse she tells lgbtq listeners to be proud of their sexuality

i love,get off my dick could be joyner pointing out to his song ultrasound on his last album and they said id never be anything that could be pointing out how people tought his album would not be that a candid interview with dj kay slay joyner lucas told of the times that he literally had to gather change from underneath the couchi was struggling eating honeybuns and flipping my couch to try to find quarters and shit to no specific pawn shop is mentioned in the song a scene depicting pleasant pawn shop was featured in the music video for winter bluesa track from joyners album in the video lucas robs what is believed to be pleasant pawn shop in lucas hometown of worcester massachusetts after dealing with financial struggles and running out of an interview with dj kayslay at shade eminems uncensored hip hop channel joyner lucas explained the meaning behind the chorus of this songin the hook im basically saying that i love but the deeper meaning behind that record is i really love success the fact that i came fromall the way from the is describing the struggles of his youth he has touched on these themes before for instance on the song mansion he saysfuck is this i wasnt supposed to be broke for this long damn it what a bitchand my manager told me nigga you gon be rich nigga you gon be richthat was last yearnow im living in the ghetto with the crackheadsworking at mcdonalds as a goddamn cashierin this instance hes reminiscing on his past because it made him who he is entendre in which joyner mentions niggas gon bleed from the nine in the trunk he goes on to say guess its that time of the month which is another way in which people describe a woman being on her period essentially hes calling out has been very vocal about his distaste and complete aversion to drug use and its being promoted or glorified in hip example occurred during an interview with ebro on hot when joyner went into pretty great detail on the subjecti dont fuck with anyone who does that shitive never been into artists promoting drug useits like when you say that to people they go and do that shitjoyner also discussed fearing his son being exposed to the drug culture of rap he doesnt allow his son to listen to anything thats promoting be down with someone is to be close and familiar sometimes intimately it comes from to be down in a foxhole with on a surface level joyner is saying the other person loved when joyner was willing to love others because the two of them were be down also means to be down on your luck or poor so joyner can be also be seen saying this person loved joyner when he wasnt successful because he was similar to that person now that hes had some success theyve drifted you consider joyner is talking about the industry hes basically saying fans loved him when he didnt have any success because he was closer to them but now that hes been fucked over by the industry labels telling him they wont put out his album lyricists taking a back seat to mumblers etc hes stopped giving a damn about everyone else and is doing what he wants his fans and the labels can take it or leave it because hes focusing on himself aint everything is common refrain like theres more to life than money and money doesnt buy happiness the colloquialism is said to reiterate a point that people shouldnt focus solely on money and also worry about their friends family neighbors and community love and happiness motivations people use to show that theres more to life than joyner is flipping that to someone coming up from the mud read poverty money buys a new life money gets you to the point where you have the luxury to worry about something daniel kahnemans book thinking fast and slow kahneman describes an experiment where money buys happiness up to the point where someone has just enough money and after that point it no longer buys happiness joyner is echoing that sentiment with these lines when you have none money is are known to sometimes count out their steps when they march in a call and response fashion joyner is saying that he loves being considered an underdog and counted out because he will soldier on and keep soldier on means to continue doing something despite it being difficult this interpretation ties in with the last two lines of this said id never be nothing they said id never be richthey said id never be anything i told em get off my dick

106,Bazzi,Mine,intro huh yeah naw i just had a lil bit too much of hennessy just gotta tell you how i feel look verse you so fuckin precious when you smile hit it from the back and drive you wild girl i lose myself up in those eyeeyeeyeeyeeyes i just had to let you know youre mine chorus hands on your body i dont wanna waste no time feels like forever even if forevers tonight just lay with me waste this night away with me youre mine i cant look away i just gotta say verse im so fucking happy youre alive swear to god im down if youre down all you gotta say is right girl anything i can do just to make you feel alright oh oh oh oh i just had to let you know youre fine running circles round my mind even when its rainy all you ever do is shine you on fire you a star just like mariah man this feel incredible ill turn you into a bride youre mine chorus hands on your body i dont wanna waste no time feels like forever even if forevers tonight just lay with me waste this night away with me youre mine i cant look away i just gotta say,that line is so real this girl is literally just sitting on my brain i cant stop thinking about you not sounding too crazy but it feels nice to think about somebody you care about everything about love is really interesting to me im young and i dont want to fall into it too hard right now just because im trying to do something with music im trying to do something for people and you need a certain level of focus to achieve that but love is a beautiful thing its what we all live for we all just want to be loved we all just want to feel somebody and feel connected to somebody in a real d do anything for somebody i care about absolutely anything but i feel like the most valuable thing you can do with somebody is be real with them share genuine feelings with them share honest feelings with them when you can give somebody something real and special i feel like thats the most valuable thing you can give someone real emotion is the most valuable thing you can give someone what i would do for somebody thats mine anything literally whatever it is that doesnt even necessarily just go for a girl its like my friends and my family if you are personal to me and we are connected in that way of deep friendship in whatever means it is i would do anything for the people that i line was really important for me its my favorite line of the entire song because i feel like people needed to hear that people really do someone out there wants you here its fucking sad people are afraid to get someones back but i want to be the guy that does i want to be the guy that encourages you and pushes you i feel like people definitely needed to hear that hook just kind of felt natural to me my music process is very whats supposed to be there or what my brain thinks is supposed to be there i dont like to be too repetitive in music and ruin something good rather than elevate you and take you somewhere else that you didnt think you were going thats my job as a creator as an artist to put you on that journey when you listen to my music and keep you in it and keep you on your toes this hook just felt big and it felt filled with so much feeling it was really easy to rock with lot of my lines in my songs are really just based off feelings sometimes ill just freestyle something over and over again until i say something i like this line came out during one of the freestyle takes and obviously mariah carey is such a star the things and records she achieved in her career are pretty wild so its cool that it worked so well but it really just came out of a freestyle and i just rocked with it i never think too hard about music because i think once you start becoming a selfconscious artist and question everything you do thats when stuff is not that good rather than when you just go with the first thing that comes to your mind and the first thing that felt good its like life just rocking with your gut thats what i did with this pull from a bunch of different places when writing this there is someone that was in my mind that definitely helped bring that feeling to the track but id say it was pretty evenly split between that and genuinely wanting to make a song for people and genuinely wanting to bring something light to a dark second i wrote the song i knew people were just gonna resonate with that a lot im happy i was right about that because i really made the song less about a person but more about wanting to give people a feeling of acceptance in a really sad world right now social media has made people so insecure and selfconscious i wanted to make something that broke through that and hit people with a message of being wanted and a message of being beautiful i think people really felt that energy it was reciprocated really hennessy line is super interesting because i used to be a huge hennessy drinker huge i would only drink hennessy i actually talk about it in a few of my songs a fan pointed it out the other day i was like fuck i do say that a lot i gotta chill but i loved hennessy and it was actually on a vibe at that whole time period of my life i would only work in the studio when i had hennessy it was a studio requirement like a fucking plug for the speakers i needed it there i was drinking a ton of hennessy at the time but now dont get me wrong but im more of a tequila guy im getting into the finer tequilas is my current favorite hennessy was very real in the creation of that line was also seriously what was happening the day i wrote the song it was a really hot summer day i was hanging with some friends and some girls by the pool we were just having a few drinks and smoking nothing crazy i went inside to grab a drink and the melody just hit me in the head i instantly knew what i wanted the entire song to look pull from a bunch of different places when writing this there is someone that was in my mind that definitely helped bring that feeling to the track but id say it was pretty evenly split between that and genuinely wanting to make a song for people and genuinely wanting to bring something light to a dark world

head in that direction after the sexual intercourse the vagina relaxes thus triggering the shedding of the uterine lining bustle and web mdaka a lot of people report sexual stimulation can often cause a girls period to start a little sooner than it was supposed is the act or offense of speaking sacrilegiously about god or sacred things considers things like love and loyalty sacred this girl lied about both of them thus showing irreverence and committing june kodak announced that he was a hebrew israelitea member of a religious group of mostly african americans who identify as the descendants of the biblical israelites associated with several different beliefs and practices he also mentioned his newfound religious affiliation on his track first day out which came out five days laterayy ayy im a israelite my diamonds is real icehere it seems as though kodak is rapping from the perspective of the media scrutinizing himself for supposedly not believing in jesus a common misconception is that hebrew israelites dont believe in jesus however they simply believe that he was black as opposed to white and refer to him as yeshua the hebrew name for jesus the religious group is also represented as the israelite church of god in jesus christ a jesus piece is a crucifix cross or face of jesus that is worn as jewelry commonly a and kendrick lamar are both inspired by hebrew israelite movement bean is one of many street names for the drug molly or mdma which is known to stimulate feelings of energy and ecstasy from the user usually after a high on a stimulant the user struggles to sleep that particularly changes the usual idiom off the bean to rolling on a bean to accomplish two things firstly he wants to relate back to the theme and title roll in peace of the songdue to fame and legal trouble kodak has a hard time enjoying life because of public fascination and intense media scrutiny thus kodak uses drugs like molly to find some peace of mind and escape the pressures of daily life created by the the other hand kodak could be using the word roll to depict the cyclical nature of using dopamine targeting drugs such as mdma because it is similar to a stimulant molly spikes dopamine levels in the brain for a short period causing the user to feel overly happy after which levels crash which leads to depression in order to feel happy again the user is forced to get high thus creating a vicious cycle of happiness and s also worth noting in conjunction with the line immediately prior this could also be a reference to the princess and the pea a fairy tale in which a small bean disturbs a princess from falling to his very frequent criminal activity kodak wears a ski mask often thus he makes the hyperbole that he would even wear it during sexual activity he also had an interview with breakfast club in which he wore a ski could also be referring to wearing a condom during sex as a form of this verse x references a classic character of science fiction yoda the force is a metaphysical and ubiquitous power in the star wars fictional universe that can allow the characters to coerce the mind or body of another being to think or do brags that he is able to force people to follow his instructions perhaps through intimidation or fear without the power of the to artist lil uzi vert theories associating x with satan have gained traction supported directly by his dark lyrics following his selection for the xxl freshman class he spits on the cypher i am a demon the son of a serpentfurthermore in an interview on the complex talk show everyday struggle joe budden called x the antichrist of the new age of rap due to this well known theory that tends to induce fear x can easily throw around threats as though he is superior to others for instance on his platinum track look at me he raps ayy you put a gun on my mansayy i put a hole in your parentsfurthermore when x raps that mean a young nigga got what on me he creates the illusion of using inverted syntax a method of speaking that yoda often uses a good example of yodas preferred linguistic pattern is demonstrated when he meets luke skywalker for the first timelooking found someone you have i would say hmmmsome rare forms sometimes common amongst speakers of japanese albanian and many other languages include subjectobjectverb verbsubjectobject or even objectsubjectverb although x doesnt use one of these forms it sounds as though he is to amplify the allusion to is letting listeners know that nowadays everything you hear from him is a freestyle meaning it is not written down first when he references a pad he is referring to the fact that he doesnt need to write his lyrics this could be a reason that listeners dont appreciate or enjoy kodaks music due to its lack of complexity and deep the freshman cypher kodak freestyles a very short verse lacking any lyrical intellect after pausing to think of another lyric towards the end he awkwardly stutters they dead fly the annotation explains that his flow was weak and the freestyle overall should have been of kodaks fame he cant enjoy the simple things in life because of the pressure from media scrutiny

koolaid for kendrick drinking the koolaid has led him to indulge in the materialistic world of hiphoprife with money sex and alcoholagainst his better bombastic assertion that an expensive cognac taste the same as a cent pack of koolaid serves to baffle the analytical types like those in the genius community in his song fear he says at age he feared being judged but now he subverts this fear

the run from the police skies then uses this to insult tayk suggesting that he is nothing to him because he was caught on the chase which illustrates how he has one already won the race and two that he is better than saying this landon could be suggesting that life has taken a turn for the worst and one of the driving factors for him coming to that conclusion is the fact that once hes become

of this has been out of spotlight and rappers have expressed hatred and attempted to feud with drake for a variety of reasons such as damaged reputations and the ending of their careers this includes artists such as common puff daddy and xxxtentacion ironically the people that he is trading bars and negative energy with are people hes never even met in person this may also be interpreted as these

144,Ella Mai,Boo'd Up,intro yeah yeah yeah yeah verse feelings so deep in my feelings no this aint really like me cant control my anxiety feeling like im touching the ceiling when im with you i cant breathe boy you do something to me prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go verse oh how many ways can i say that i need you baby its true i think i might die without you feeling all over my body you know how i like it aint gotta tell you what to do yeah yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bridge head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more baby hah i wanna build this love and everything you want you aint gotta ask for you got me bood up bood up bood up bood up told you from the jump id only choose ya ya got me bood up bood up bood up bood up grab me by the waist baby pull me closer yeah prechorus ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new that get me high like you do yeah yeah ooh no ill never get over you until i find something new yeah baby that get me high like you do chorus listen to my heart go bado bood up ooh bood biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go bado bood up biddydado bood up hear my heart go bado bood up biddydado it just wont stop it go,this is a bit of a play on words here as ella is referring to the joys of being bood up and the sparks of a new relationship but she also cleverly uses badum bood up to mimic the sound of a heartbeat which is also a symbolism of im the one to choose when im right i know im right when im wrong i know im wrong it might take me a minute but i know im wrong but when im right im right so told you from the jump id always choose youi told you i was going to be the one basically and here i am the s like reassurance but thats also building trust you have to definitely let the person know and again thats communication as well you have to reassure people and let them know im still here even if youre not going through a bad situation even just telling someone i love you before its too late even outside of a romantic relationship like family just telling people you love them and showing your love for anyone you love is very important because you never know it also feels good when someone says i love you or someone explains to you how they is definitely number one without trust theres no point you cant move forward i think trusting communication being honest which is again part of trusting i think its definitely something you have to take one step at a time i dont think there is something that you can put in chronological order to say right this is what we do and were going to take it off the checklist every one situation is completely different but trust i would say is the number one m a strong believer of when you go out searching for something you dont really find exactly what youre searching for because i think youre too concentrated on number one number two number three number fourall these different things that perfection doesnt exist so if you go out searching for something that you have to take off all these different boxes youre not going to find someone that takes off every single box because that just doesnt exist right when you dont look for it and it just kind of comes out of nowhere and surprises you it almost feels like all those boxes are ticked anyway even if theres something at the bottom of the list that isnt it but its just again the feeling of love i think love in general can definitely sweep you off your feet and thats why i say head over heels in love right in front of you aint gotta look no more its like you dont have to search anymore if you were searching you dont have to search anymore and even if you dont you dont have to search anymore because im not going if your heart stops beating you die you stop breathing you die and you no longer exist i feel like sometimes you can be so in love with someone or just infatuated with someone that you feel like if they leave what are you going to do like theres nothing left for me to do when of course there is but that feeling again is if i dont have you then i dont know how ill do with myself especially when you get so used to a situation as well and youre like this is what im used to ive been with you for however many years blah blah blah im used to this then all of a sudden for arguments sake again theyre not there then you feel like you might as well not be there either it can be very hard but were sticking to the positive side of love definitely think love is a drug its something that you can be so caught up on for so long and i think thats also why people stay in good relationships and thats why people stay in bad relationships because its almost like an addiction you get addicted to the person and you cant let go of them especially when youve been together for years and years and years theres just so much history and its hard to detach yourself i feel like sometimes love overrides your mind your brain and your thinking s almost like you begin to believe that this is like a fairy talk or its almost too good to be true then you start to think down the line of wow now i have this to compare everything else to for arguments sake god forbid it doesnt work out in this situation the next person i find if theyre not showing me the same feelings and im not feeling the same way about them as i feel about you then im never going to get over you

or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists

cleaners,em has used similar metaphors on still dont give a fuck now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debti cant rap anymore i just murdered the alphabetand on im back where he rapsi murder a rhyme one word at a timealso notice the play on words with to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows and to rape the alpha bet i may raise some browseminem has never been afraid of criticizing himself throughout almost his entire career whether he be rapping about lying to his daughter about his drug problems on his song dj vu making lowquality music and not being able to live up to expectations on walk on water getting old and not knowing when to quit on the latter half of bad guy or failing to properly lead his former rap group d on stepping stoneeven his most popular critically acclaimed albums like the marshall mathers lp have received heavy criticism mostly due to profane lyrics which caused a lot of controversy eminem as seen throughout his career has no problem with crass lyrics and he knows that wont appeal to everyone and as he gets older and his fanbase declines partly due to his own volition he knows he cant be perfect but he can be honest and that is one of the things he believes hell be remembered people use the phrase new me killed the old me meaning their old ways are forgotten and no longer a part of their the phrase around eminem is suggesting that his old ways came back to take control of him once again which seems to be his more sadistic violent and pissed off slim shady alterego he thought he had gotten rid uses several examples to show that hes always got his eyes open including a play on words and a subject of continued eminem makes a play on the expression to nod off nodding off is an expression for falling asleep as the head slowly droops as someone loses consciousness mimicking a slow nod its noteworthy that nodding along to a beat doesnt necessarily mean that ones eyes are em claims that he doesnt even close his eyes when he sneezes most people close their eyes when they sneeze as an automatic reflex it is also a longstanding myth that ones eyes will pop out of their head if they were to sneeze with their eyes opencrest whitestrips are teeth whiteners that commonly irritate or cause increased sensitivity to ones gumsteeth so imagine how it must feel to have one jammed down ones dick with an ice pick em goes on to describe other ways to mutilate his genitals such as using a vise grip which essentially is a wrench that can tightly lock something in place in this instance ems dick on top of a spike fence pictured belowfrom the beginning of his career to present em has rapped about his own genital mutilation back in s the slim shady lp he raps on role modeli tie a rope around my penis and jump from a treeyou probably wanna grow up to be just like methese bars arent simply for gruesome shock value as em later goes on to explain hed rather endure such agony than hear you on a mic referring to the aforementioned mumble rappers earlier in the can use a nightclub a weapon to smash someone in addition having a nightclub on smash refers to be having a a good party also notice the implied pun with nightclub by the use of club and nightstickbefore modern medicine physicians would hold mirrors to the human mouth and look for fog to determine if a person was still evil spelled adlib was added in postproduction as a subtle jab towards critics who failed to notice some of the complex rhyme schemes from his album revival eminem addresses critics directly later in this track the adlib itself rhymes with evil spell and notes that he spelt out evil on this track em spoon fed listeners a pun in a similar fashionmaybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get item decides to rewind and slow down themedia meaty a line for the listeners since they dont necessarily have the comprehensive skills to understand the is also reflected earlier in the song when he rapscause you missed a line and never caught itcause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get itcause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartestem has been involved in several beefs throughout his career for example his beef with benzino and the source magazine in the early s the dispute eventually evolved to include all rappers from shady records and all rappers from benzinos crew made men well known tracks from the beef include benzinos pull your skirt up and die another day and ems the sauce and nail in the coffin where he attacked both the credibility of the source and benzinos rap notable feud was his beef with ja rule which he inherited after he signed cent to shady records ja mentioned ems daughter hailie on the track loose changeem you claim your mothers a crackheadand kim is a known slutso whats hailie gon be when she grows upthis led to ems brutal response on the track doe rae me hailies revenge which famously contributed to ending jas careerhailie what do you want to be when

lady who is waiting urgently for her man to come back from tourhit him on the jack is likely a wordplay that references the classic rb song hit the road jack by ray charles since post is on the road his lady can only contact him by hitting his phone and wonders how long will it take for the tour to accordance with the previous line here nicki implies that while bitches try to compete with her guys want to have sex with she refers to icethe slang term for diamond jewelry as she brags about receiving a lot of gifts from men trying to seduce her which explains the snow comparison this topic is also touched upon in rich sexi know what these niggas like and it aint my charmi aint stupid this on my armthough post doesnt seem to have a criminal history he expresses the love that his girl has for him due to her willingness to protect him whatever post has been charged or accused of the girl is willing to take the fall or face the consequences for the actions of someone charging foul in basketball terminology refers to when an offensive player charges into a defensive player who has already established themselves on the court usually knocking the defensive player over while not moving into the offensive players path considering the name of the song is ball for me its clear post was using drive is a street in beverly hills california known for being the host to many designer and luxury brand storefronts shops include saint laurent balenciaga gucci burberry louis vuitton and many more references to rodeo can be heard in the lyrics of many rappers including but not limited to kanye west savage and tyga this is not the first time malone has referenced rodeo most popularly in his single money made me do it featuring took the lincoln down rodeopost gives his girl to spend at the variety of stores on rodeo implies that if her significant other is a she is also a making them a perfect match it could also mean that she adds value to any man in her lifetend stresses the repetition of the number in the previous had a similar line recently on young thugs song anybodywhen i send that new bae alert niggas gon be madif you a i add attend to ya meaning if the guy shes with

post got an old ford explorer restored increasing the formerly beatup suvs value by at least post reportedly had the idea to customize a explorer so he bought one for and sent it to west coast customs who customized also has a white rolls royce wraith which west coast customs also claims to have a watch on his wrist post has a collection of luxury watches including rolexes audemars piguets and

cigarette early in his careernicki comes through with another reference to how these bitches is her sons which showcases her influence and how she birthed many female rappers this phrase started on her song did it onemthis time she plays on the word son which sounds like sun and the sun of course shines in daylight this also plays off the previous line when vampires are exposed to sunlight for

153,AC/DC,Highway to Hell,instrumental intro verse living easy living free season ticket on a one way ride asking nothing leave me be taking everythin in my stride dont need reason dont need rhyme aint nothing id rather do goin down party time my friends are gonna be there too yeah chorus im on the highway to hell on the highway to hell highway to hell im on the highway to hell verse no stop signs speed limit nobodys gonna slow me down like a wheel gonna spin it nobodys gonna mess me around hey satan payin my dues playing in a rocking band hey mama look at me im on the way to the promised land woo chorus im on the highway to hell highway to hell im on the highway to hell highway to hell puente dont stop me heh heh guitar solo chorus im on the highway to hell on the highway to hell highway to hell im on the highway to hell highway to hell im on the highway to hell highway to hell highway to hell highway to hell highway to hell highway to hell outro and im going down all the way im on the highway to hell,the promised land was supposed to be gods gift but to the singer his promised land was a gift from satan that sums it uphis wild life will keep on spinning despite other peoples attempts to cut his knows his narcissistic ways will be the death of him but its such a thrill at the time that to him he is ok with the inevitable crashmaking it a bit more overt who the song is directed at mama is the one who always said to live clean go to church and be a good boy she could be proud of the singer is anything but what mama wanted and he thinks her wishes for him were wrong since they arent nearly as highway analogy comes from the bibles euphemism of walk to mean lifestyle it has been a part of the english language for centuries showing up in literature and songs many means that he knows that its going to be fun and all but since hes going to be with his friends and everything there is going to be some chaos this is to be expected when hanging with friends and wanting to have a good is a hint that the singer knows he wont live as long with the wild rock and roll lifestyle hes made it clear he doesnt care but he admits that the life hes living can only kill him eventually whats ironic is that hes ok with that preferring to have a great time during a short life rather than skip the parties and live to a ripe old pay ones dues is to earn respect or a right by hard work sacrifice or experience bon scott says he is paying his dues or sacrificing to satan by playing in a rocking band for his respect or his right to be famous making a deal with the devil is a famous trope used in many songs of different genres such as eminems say goodbye to hollywoodfollowing the hit lead singer bon scott died due to acute alcohol poisoning in although there are inconsistencies about his death leading to fans theorizing he may have actually overdosed on heroin although the rest of acdc denies this rumor the last person to see him alistair kinnear had gone missing in only leading to more theorizing and loves his excess filled party lifestyle and has no intention of changing he knows this life could ultimately be the death of him but he says whatever im having so much fun ill party in hell after my deathin many ways this is a direct rebellion against mainstream christian culture as it was in the late s the values of mom and dad teachers police priests and pastors and practically every other adult authority figure they say that youll die young and go to hell if you do all the things you think are fun like drink have sex do drugs stay up all night drive too fast etc the singer is thumbing his nose at that idea by doing all of those and more and believes himself to be proving them wrong by suffering no ill effects evidence by the fact that hes able to sing this song about course considering what happened to the singer a year after this song perhaps they might have had a point

much and by having made this song he can finally be heard and bring that to the you look at the song in more detail you see that he keeps mentioning paranoia and saying how it does not want to make this work once again referring to the bad voices running through his mind which this person is is a mental condition characterized by delusions of persecution unwarranted jealousy or exaggerated selfimportance typically worked into an organized system it may be an aspect of chronic personality disorder of drug abuse or of a serious condition such as schizophrenia in which the person loses touch with reality by saying paranoia what did i do wrong this time he might not actually be addressing paranoia but a person that is in the back of his head the one that keeps telling him that he isnt worth it and not good enough as his rise of fame was so fast his voice in the back of his head increased and to let out his emotions he wrote a song to make it easier for him to cope with he could also be losing touch with reality at this point because of the fast jump in popularity which overwhelms him mind a interview with nme nf described the meaning behind let you down and who he was letting s just about me growing up feeling like i didnt really have much of a voice or i wasnt being heard now that im an adult its just me expressing some feelings i still feel but also feelings that ive worked through through my life from being a kid to a teenager to being an adult now its like when you go through those phases and when you look back you look at it a lot different like when people say you look back at your past when youre older and you look at things differently its like such a real moment for me right describes a onesided argument where he feels that he will never be right no matter how much he states his opinion or wants to tell the other person how he is feeling he will always be wrong in their shared in all i have how he always wanted someone to hear i ever wanted was somebody to hear meand all i ever wanted was somebody to feel me

part of the reason she wanted young thug featured on the track is that he is from explained why she recruited young thug to rap on havanai have been a really big fan of young thug and i think because havana is an unconventional song i didnt want just a goto mainstream rapper that has done a bunch of pop features i felt like he would bring just the right flavour to close range will vary based on a

that his significant other did not reciprocate a similar interest in the speculate that he may be referring to his previous partner selena gomez who he had a short but passionate relationship performing this song at coachella it is evident this person had a special place in his heart as he started crying towards the outro of the weeknds ex selena gomez turned years old on july nd of back when they were still dating when selena came on instagram live to greet her fans someone asked the singer where abel the weeknd was during the celebrations and she revealed that he was actually on his way home to where is abel the weekndselena gomez abels on his way home weeknd also shared a similar sentiment on his instagram stories in which his song i feel it coming can be heard and the caption reads on my way to you he had been in paris performing and got a flight back immediately to los angeles for could be referring to his breakup with selena gomez shortly after they broke up she started dating her ex justin bieber not giving abel enough time to get over the the other hand abel was spotted leaving bella hadids apartmentwho he dated previous to gomezshortly after indicating that maybe he didnt need much time after lines also call back to thursday where he sings on the birds part she said please mercy me mercy melet me fall outta love before you fuck herthe birds part by was released roughly years before this song back then the weeknd would describe himself as somewhat emotionless and would disregard the slightest chances of having a serious relationship hed hint that women would be foolish to fall in love with him due to these personality traits when used in comparison with the current track a significant change in abels life and his ways is tables have definitely turned since his thursday mixtape in the most ironic of ways he now finds himself in love with someone begging her not to leave he asks her to stay a little longer in order to ease the pain of her future departure much as the woman on the birds part asked him years painful as this may be for him it does portray his emotional growth in relation to woman he allowed himself to care for someone enough to get pit stop refers to the pit where a racecar driver stops in the middle of a race to refuel andor service the weeknd uses a pit stop as a metaphor to suggest that a girl whom he put on top had just used him for her own needs almost in the same vein that a car refuels at a pit stop he states that she had not actually been in love with him in the same way he had felt towards is most likely a reference to his relationship with fellow singer selena gomez selena and abel broke up on october after months of dating the very next day photos emerged of selena reuniting with her former boyfriend justin bieber whom she split in hence abel would have been selenas metaphorical pit is notorious for his sexual escapades he has not only spoken about his sexual prowess but also how

signifies a big step for me as a human being as well as a step forward sonically from album smoke mirrors i was in a low state dealing with depression for a year straight and then i came home reconnected with family and friends did selfhelp and reached out to a therapist we worked through a lot of shit i had been dealing with and i think it gave me new perspective to reflect on the band and see it with more clear eyes i just had a lot of gratitude for the low points and highs of my life thats what believer is about and the fact that its resonating with people is really prechorus acts as the pursuit of finally letting ones pain out instead of bottling it up while the chorus is the aftermath of making it through that pain with honor and compares the act of bottling your emotions to condensation and to water flowing away from land and back again the water may be symbolical of ones body while the condensation and flowing represents the consequence behind ignoring ones instinct of feeling with sadness is fundamental to ones health when one shies away from confronting inner anguish it can result in an exaggerated sense of anxietythis is highlighted with the imagery of rain after referencing theres an escapefollowing melancholic confessions of insecurity a conclusion of breaking out of this anguish is reached with the speakers emotions overflowing and pouring out along with the rainbeliever opens with a proclamation suggesting that all the words that follow are a confession painting the rest of the songs defiant lyrics with a patina of greater hes about to say is something thats been percolating for a while this is simultaneously something thats had him intensely upset and passionate fired up and has been a longstanding problem long enough for him to be tired of itdan reynolds of imagine dragons admitted he had a rough year struggling with depression luckily a strong support system and a desire to feel better helped him see the band with clearer he was interviewed by he saidbeliever means a lot to me because it really signifies a big step for me as a human being as well as a step forward sonically from album smoke mirrors i was in a low state

reminiscent of zen philosophy pain is viewed here as a means to spiritual ascension growth and overall happiness asserted is that without the spiritual and physical pain he went through in his place of darkness the light wouldnt have been diagnosis of both ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis unequivocally contributed to the experience of said darkness dan reynolds spoke to describing believer as a transition from a darker place to a place of lightcoming out the other side the band seems to feel more genuine and unique than ever reynolds commentedbeliever to me is the first song ive ever written in my career that i could stand back and say that is only imagine dragonsthat comes from a place that is really authentic to us its very percussive it has the urban qualities that ive always latched onto but it also sounds strange and kind of speaks from his mormon faith as religion gave him guidance through all the hatred he encountered mightve caused him pain it led him to contemplate on how to avoid it and be a peaceful man its only suitable he alludes to the dove a symbol of peace the bible mentions it several times notably in the table of noahs ark where the dove plucks an olive branch as a sign that the violent great flood is receding

when i was in the studio with quavo he literally wrote his whole part of two souls on fire in the booth and was just like really shocked so i was like how do i do that i want to learn to do lot of times ill just go into the booth and just say lyrics when i was working with justin i was like have a drink on me cheers to the failing that line was kind of i dont know its just sometimes you get into those moments where you feel like you mess up and youre like well i already messed up so i might as well mess up more obviously thats not the answer but thats a real thing and feeling so i put it in my culture my dad was always that kind of guy who would always pay for everything i think i kind of took after my dad being more of the man and the guy i want to be around people that truly love me for who i am and arent around me and my lifestyle just to be in the vibe in the world and then like get free stuff all the time because usually thats the case nobody really shows up unless im like well im paying for the drinks and theyre like oh ok you know theyll be like no we cant come out i had a crazy week ahead im like im paying and theyll be like ok im there you got a table im comingalso as i started making more money in the music business i started seeing that more and more because people were like well you got money you should pay for everything well its like how about no its not even about buying me anything its about the thank you at the end when people start not even saying thank you anymore thats kind of disrespectful you know i tell my friends that i understand too my friends i always hook them up with tons of stuff but im like you dont need to get me something crazy i dont want a chanel bag but if you could buy me a coffee just like when you get coffee sometimes that means the world to me you know so i think in life thats how sometimes people feel you dont want to ever feel like youre being used you know you want to be loved for who you are you knowim a mess for your love it aint newthis song was based on a story it was a whole bunch of things and there was a situation where it was unrequited love i was going through that but i didnt want to just make it all about laughing about yourself because i feel like some people may not be able to do that the one thing i feel like people could relate to universally is love and being rejected by love so i wanted to have a piece of that in there because i feel like sometimes love can make you feel that has helped me since i was younger i think that just having someone that you can talk to thats like not biased sometimes when you talk to your friends or your family they always want the best for you but sometimes its good to have somebody who is kind of out of it all and you can talk to them i tell a lot of my fans that too sometimes its really just about talking to someone even if you cant afford it or you dont have insurance or whatever it may be even if you could just talk to a friend that is better than nothing i think its mostly just being able to get your feelings out i think a lot of anger and sadness and pain and hurt comes from not being able to truly express how you feel i think that therapy is really me the song kind of embodies everything that i was feeling at this moment or in my life its like sometimes you gotta be sarcastic in life and be able to laugh at yourself or youre just gonna lose it so i was like ok well thats what my therapist says so im going to put it in there either people are going to listen to this song and be like this girl had a lot of issues or theyre going to be like no shes just like me i have issues but she is not afraid to say it i think everybody is a little crazy but some of us hide it better than others and we all have things going on in our think selflove is every thing when youre in a relationship with somebody i truly feel like its like taking a magnifying glass and not only putting it over the relationship but putting it over yourself so anything that you feel insecure about with yourself is going to come out in the relationship if youre insecure about trust issues or whatever it may be and i think that working on yourself is truly something really important and learning to love yourself and everybody says that but its the truth i think its like a daily try to be the best person i can for the first couple lines of the song it was just a sense of how i was feeling in my life i just felt like everything was chaos and i elt like everything was literally a mess you know my dating life my personal life i just kind of felt lost and confused you know i think we all have those has helped me since i was younger i think that just having someone that you can talk to thats like not biased sometimes when you talk to your friends or your family they always want the best for you but sometimes its good to have somebody who is kind of out of it all and you can talk to them i tell a lot of my fans that too sometimes its really just about talking to someone even if you cant afford it or you dont have insurance or whatever it may be even if you could just talk to a friend that is better than nothing i think its mostly just being

brokedown car and four years no call now im lookin pretty in a hotel bar and iii cant stop no iii cant stop chorus andrew taggart halsey so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover that i know you cant afford bite that tattoo on your shoulder pull the sheets right off the corner of the mattress that you stole from your roommate back in boulder we aint ever getting older postchorus andrew taggart halsey we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older chorus andrew taggart so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover that i know you cant afford bite that tattoo on your shoulder pull the sheets right off the corner of the mattress that you stole from your roommate back in boulder we aint ever getting older postchorus andrew taggart halsey we aint ever getting older no we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older no we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older no we aint ever getting older we aint ever getting older no we aint ever getting older,halseys opening line introduces an opposite to andrew taggart she takes the role of the subject in this song turning it from a monologue to a backandforth and delivering a juicy bit of insight she misses him too shes second guessing her choice of leaving him based on looks and not remembering why they broke up because she cant help but adore him for all the good last three words might be a subtle nod towards gasoline a track off of halseys debut album badlands where the first lyrics askare you insane like meshes second guessing her choice of leaving him based on looks and not remembering why they broke up because she cant help but adore him for all the good had been playing i miss you in our sets a lot at the time and blink was on our minds a lot so thats where that idea came from blink also played a large role in our musical history growing up as for tucson it just rhymed and also touches on the geographical special references we use in the just used that setting as the perfect scenario for something like this to happen commonly running into people in hotels or destinations unexpectedly it paints a very vivid image of the pretty girl at the bar with a cocktail and that sort of rush of memories and emotions mostly physical leading to a hook think its just the acknowledgement of each others flaws as people and the denial of some of them as well college and growing up at its finest selfexploration and selfrealization its less about drinking to get over and more about the lifestyle that one leads in college and sometimes after as a result in the case of the song with halsey its really a dialogue thats taking could mean a few things partially that we are stuck in time repeating a mistake of the past not learning or growing from it but it also refers to the light heartedness of this period in our song is sort of comical in nature we wanted to make a feel good song about meeting your ex falling for them on a physical level and them remembering all the horrible truths about why it didnt work out so hopefully the lyrics evoke some sort of emotional connection to people but we want people to have fun with song relates closely to the spoiled girls of college who have family money but also live this dichotomy of the broke college life for this visually range rovers and boulder communicated that the getting too specific we wanted to write a song about something personal to us but relatable to many classically there are lots of hot girls at syracuse that he would run into and find himself attracted to but forget all the things he hated about them college for us is mostly where that happened so in this case cuse thats really not relevant but enough to make a song about were

have to relocate,proposed suggestiondo to their wealth and celebrity status travis scott and nav typically use a private jet in order to travel long distances or overseas since both artists are based in north america they may have fallen asleep due to the long flight times which implies that they are going international and reaching levels of global success which requires them to travel all around

marijuana on his private plane marijuana is illegal federally and prohibited on flights but nav can afford to fly private thus he can bring whatever he wants celebrities like nav attract the attention of the media fans and quite numerously females his line describes that none of the females who try to be in his face by messaging him and trying to gain his attention are not welcomed instead he is in the pursuit of money which is where the lyric my pockets full of faces comes into play american currency typically has at least one face of a deceased politician on it therefore meaning that a pocket full of faces means that nav has a lot of navs opinion a female which has over a hundred thousand followers on the social media and picture sharing website instagram then that female is considered too famous nav would prefer a female with less attention as she would be less likely to be noticed by other men and would be more likely to keep her and navs relationship out of the limelightbags are are

stars are closer this may be the night that my dreams might let me know all the stars are closer all the stars are closer all the stars are closer,szas riff during this prechorus contains the same melodic consonance that was heard in the chorus of her breakout hit love galore another song that dives into the theme of to the message of this song however sza isnt one to talk about love with her significant other as explained in a genius verified annotation i actually dont argue i dont wanna argue id just rather not talk to you so its like if we go off and really go there to the point where im talking crazy its like were probably never going to talk to each other again by the time im done because of me and my as in communication with god expressing gratitude and worries pleading seeking hope and safety the many meanings of praying is something which lamar has explored with his album damn in songs such as element humble and feelexbitch all my grandmas deadso aint nobody prayin for me im on your head ayynobody pray for meits been that day for mein this verse one might notice the implied contrast between skin covered in ego and praying as a humble ritual sza expresses harmony between confidence and gratitude and its for no reason it comes naturally using prayer as imagery also functions as an homage to many mcs kendrick is known for bravado breaking the mold and making light of the acclaim he receives dna fresh off the success of damn he is not interested in basking in accolades or accepting praise from former killmonger wastes no time politicking with former enemies he is an unconventional wakandan leader who is laserfocused on achieving his broadly this could be kendrick preempting the praise that the film would receive by saying that an afrocentric blockbuster never needed the approval of a eurocentric society and never needed to meet its expectations eithersza uses computerrelated wordplay here computers have an onoff switch but also a ctrl key pronounced control perhaps like the machine itself szas actions are at the whim of the user or in this case a person who might literally be using her know you mean wrong alternatively she might not be functioning properly at all around this person like a computer with no offswitch or ctrl s debut album was also titled ctrl the cover art depicted her with old used february nd the song was updated on apple music with all but the first two lines in szas verse changed here are the lyrics as can be heard on the soundtrackskin covered in egoget to talkin like a endforth like a reboundgot no end game got no reasongot to stay down its the way that you making me feellike nobody ever loved me like you do you doyou kinda feeling like youre tryna get away from meif you do i wont movei aint just crying for no reasoni aint just praying for no reasoni give thanks for the days for the hoursand another way another life breathini did it all cause it feel goodi wouldnt do it at all if it feel badbetter live your life were runnin out of timekendrick is doing a couple of things here first calling back real recognize real and deploying the real v fake dichotomy often used by mcs also in keeping with the theme of the verse he knows that people want something from him even though they may pretend not to second as far as comics go tchallablack panther is a master tactician and strategist in the marvel universe an effective king is able to anticipate moves and to know the motivations and calculations of his might be a reference to the biblical story of adam and eve which explains mans original sin eve gave adam the gift of an apple from the tree of knowledge which corrupted them both and resulted in their expulsion from the garden of edenthough it was the fault of the serpent who originally tricked eve into eating the could also be a reference to ecclesiastes surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the this verse kendrick raps from a dubious distrustful and hardhearted mans perspectivefuck you and all your expectationsi dont even want your is why he states he is building his vision with a small percentage of people because he has decided from past experiences that the majority of people arent trustworthy kendrick also raps about this same feeling of skepticism on pridethis keep your circle small mentality is a recurring theme in hiphop tupac one of kendricks most noted influences is often credited with the saying the realest people dont have a lot of friendsthis also relates to the black panther film since the main protagonist tchalla had a small circle of people his trusted his sister shuri his love interest nakia and his friend feels that due to his fame people think they are entitled to his feels that the only person who is important is one who is the moral to the story meaning heshe has the solution to the problem that has been plaguing the world for centuries the lens of the mcu black panther is still a relatively new hero introduced in captain america civil war he has not yet had a major part in saving the world but he owes nothing to the avengershe is the king of wakanda and need not prove anything to the predominantly white entitled heroes
